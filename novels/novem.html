That was the motto of the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. Operated in the depths of Indianapolis, the division had recently received a bizarre mystery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Tom, we&#39;re stumped...The men, all twenty-three of them we&#39;ve sent...they&#39;ve all gone missing without a trace!&quot; Barry said, his voice lingering in concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tom dropped his head into his hands and looked down, with nothing but frustration in his mind. &quot;I know! I know! Can you please shut up? What am I supposed to do?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What about the intern? Crazy smart 19-year-old kid, who finished a master&#39;s in anthropology! He said he&#39;s coming in today!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m not risking it! I could be fired!&quot; Tom yelled, slamming his fist into the desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The door slowly creaked open upon Tom&#39;s last words, as a dark silhouette appeared, fading in, uncloaking a boy with wavy umber hair and a pair of mystic black eyes of death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear you two,&quot; the boy smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; Tom asked, still angry. The boy gracefully ran his fingers through his hair, flicking it backwards. Barry, disappointed, facepalmed and swivelled around on his chair, regaining his attention to his computer where he was halfway through his work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;El-&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re Elias right?&quot; Tom interrupted. Barry couldn&#39;t hold his laughter and giggled, frustrating Tom even more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s a case here. The Mona Lisa, 23 disappearances. Some say there&#39;s a curse attached, but I don&#39;t buy it,&quot; Tom mumbled, tossing a folder toward Elias. &quot;Read through that, and good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias caught the folder, flipping through the file&#39;s sparse notes and thinking back to what had led him here. He knew of his talents that paved this path, and he knew if it meant facing off with a so-called cursed painting, so be it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Still, Elias disliked this ignorant attitude, catching the folder with ease. He quickly flipped through it and skimmed the brief, highlighting the phrase: &quot;23 Disappearances on this Case&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well? What are you waiting for?&quot; Tom yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Jesus Tom! Shut the fuck up!&quot; Barry interrupted. &quot;He&#39;s the fucking intern!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plane flight was tedious, but Elias pulled through the jet lag and landed in Paris. He&#39;d never been to Europe and had only seen media of it, and experiencing everything all at once was like a dream come true. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Louvre was more than an experience, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see, to view ancient paintings, artifacts and stories. The faint scent of polished wood and stone of the Louvre mingled with the lingering breath of time as Elias entered the grandeur rooms of the exhibition, emitting a magical aura. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was careful, not to seem suspicious. He slowly made his way towards the Mona Lisa painting, where the majority of the people had gathered around. Suddenly, a hand rested on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias turned around, shocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Been a while, hasn&#39;t it Elias?&quot; James smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;James? I haven&#39;t seen you since high school!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What brings you here?&quot; James asked. &quot;I&#39;m here on vacation!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Work for me,&quot; Elias said, rolling his eyes. &quot;Got into a supernatural intelligence division...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Really? That sounds cool!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The people there are dicks,&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s unfortunate...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, this is my first case, and it&#39;s about the Mona Lisa...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Did you know, the Mona Lisa has a flaw? I&#39;ve heard rumours that DaVinci has a badly placed stroke near the hands...&quot; James remarked. James walked forward for a better view and reached out, pointing at the flaw. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t get that close!&quot; Elias chirped. James didn&#39;t hear Elias through the thick noise produced by the crowd, unaware of his surroundings. Then, a man pushed forward through the crowd, bumping James and making him lose his balance. His hand unfortunately scraped the painting, leaving a faint mark on it as he descended and landed on the ground with an oof.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;James! Are you good?&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine- Argh!&quot; James screamed as he got up. His hand was gone, literally cut off, but there was no blood surprisingly. His hand had seemed to disappear out of thin air, Elias considering that James&#39;s hand might have been translated into a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Aaah!&quot; a man screamed, fading away. Elias&#39;s eyes darted around the room and witnessed people disappearing, along with their body parts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Elias yelled. He drew his attention back to the Mona Lisa painting. The woman in the painting was gone and chaos had begun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! Help! Help me-&quot; James screamed as the rest of his body faded away, leaving only his face. It wasn&#39;t long before everything went dark for Elias, for he was also transferred into a new, magical realm. It was indeed dark, Elias&#39;s vision was engulfed with shadows and only after what seemed to be hours, did Elias finally slowly open his tired eyes to see the clear blue sky. James quickly approached Elias and leaned down, helping Elias up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! You&#39;re awake!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Where are we?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Didn&#39;t you major in history? You should know this!&quot; James panicked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Jesus, it&#39;s anthropology, not history. I&#39;ll take a look,&quot; Elias replied frailly. &quot;It can&#39;t be...This isn&#39;t our world...We&#39;re in a different dimension...It feels like it...And it also feels like we&#39;re in 16th-century Europe!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;We need to get outta here,&quot; a man said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I agree,&quot; James added. &quot;But where do we start?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;There...&quot; Elias announced. He pointed towards a small flight of stairs that began just up ahead, just beyond the path. A massive castle stood upon them, and the only thing that blocked them from entering it was the set of doors. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they crossed the cobbled footpath and descended the flight of stairs, a small sign with the word &quot;Library&quot; in serif letters was placed beside the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">James pushed the creaking wooden door open, flooding the pitch-black library with the bright sunlight. The walls were infested with mould and cracks, implying the abandoned nature of the structure. The bookshelves seemed untouched, with them reaching to the ceiling, acting as pillars of some sort. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias carefully stepped into the library, with the dust-ridden floor creating squeaky sounds that echoed amongst the bookshelves. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at all this dirt, guh!&quot; a woman exclaimed. &quot;Those cobwebs! Yuck!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Indeed, the library seemed abandoned, but the books seemed clean, and shinier than anything else in place. It certainly contrasted the dull brown palette adopted by the library, creating somewhat of a welcoming yet ominous atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Phones everyone! Turn your flashlight on and start looking around!&quot; Elias commanded. It was suddenly much brighter with the addition of the flashlights, making it much easier to navigate the labyrinth-like layout of a library.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Now isn&#39;t the time to smoke Howard...&quot; a woman barked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Lisa, this helps me calm down!&quot; Howard explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Smoking? Great! Give me that lighter!&quot; Elias exclaimed. Howard stood in shock, with his lighter in his hand. Elias snatched it and smiled. &quot;Thanks, man, and don&#39;t smoke in here,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">James helped Elias light the candles in the library, adding some natural light that helped illuminate the darkness and help conserve the batteries of their phones. It was much cosier now that there was some sort of light, and hence they were able to begin exploring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at this Elias, a book.&quot; James signalled. He picked the book titled &quot;Divine Arts&quot; up from a nearby table and flipped it open. People nearby huddled beside James, trying to read the contents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;May the most tender item lead to a graceful flight. Maybe sometimes you must not just paint through the night.&quot; Elias read. &quot;I&#39;m assuming tender refers to the youngest thing in the library...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll start checking the books,&quot; a woman added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Same here!&quot; another chirped in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t long before everyone began to search for the youngest thing. Elias didn&#39;t care about the books, he pondered on the statement as he explored the library.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Many people began inspecting the bookshelves to analyse the most recent books, but there was no luck. Instead of success, only misfortune came in the shape of fantastical yet horrendous monsters. The books the people checked slowly transformed into horrible, bloodthirsty creatures with a pair of wings and sharp, pointy teeth. They were relentlessly chasing whoever opened them and chomping their arms, legs or even heads off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The group was in shambles, screams filled the maze of bookshelves and chaos was imminent. Panic quickly arose and Elias realised that this was nothing he had done before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Youngest...&quot; Elias thought. &quot;Time...?&quot; Elias gazed at the grandfather clock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...doesn&#39;t this look like the Mona Lisa?&quot; James interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What does?&quot; Elias asked while he remained lost in thought by the grandfather clock. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That canvas...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias darted his eyes to the green canvas, realising that it was indeed the half-finished Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I know where we are...and I think I know how to get out...&quot; Elias muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hurry up! There&#39;s a ghost coming!&quot; James screamed. Elias again, turned around to see in shock the abomination of a ghost that faded into existence. A devilish green monster, plagued with ridiculous wrinkles and demon red eyes appeared, of what seemed to resemble the Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You dare fool around here?&quot; the Mona Lisa hissed. In the background, the constant flapping of book monsters ticked Elias, annoying him ever so more. The gruesome squeals of pain and death were inevitable, as the book monsters began slowly consuming the remaining people one by one. It was complete chaos and all some could do was run; they didn&#39;t have time to mourn the death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, distract the ghost!&quot; Elias directed, taking out his gun. He loaded a magazine into the gun and aimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What? How?&quot; James asked. However, it was too late for Elias had already run back and began shooting a few book monsters down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa took advantage of James as he didn&#39;t know how to distract her, crawling into his skin and haunting him. James was scared. It felt like thousands of glass shards had pierced his skin, and the sensation of the ghostly figure phasing through his body made him tremble with utter fear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His breath hitched, coming in shallow gasps, followed by his heart beating at the speed of light, forcing cold sweat to drip from his forehead. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Please...Don&#39;t kill me!&quot; James wailed as he stumbled to the ground. He gazed up, the Mona Lisa loomed over him with a deathly stare. Her eyes were like the devil&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Back off!&quot; Elias shouted, firing a bullet at the Mona Lisa. The bullet phased through the ghostly properties of her body, striking the wall. The Mona Lisa somehow felt the sensation of an object passing through her body and turned her attention towards Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa slowly closed the distance between it and Elias and mumbled, &quot;Why do humans trespass on this sacred land?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Fuck! One bullet left...&quot; Elias exclaimed as he inspected the barrel. &quot;Unless...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; James yelled. Elias hesitated, quickly scanning the area again to make sure he was right. He knew something was off about the location and that there was a much larger problem with higher stakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the grandfather clock struck midday, and the pendulum swung back and forth and produced a deafening vibration that paralysed the Mona Lisa in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias suddenly realised that time was the key, and that the grandfather clock played a vital role in the solution of the curse. There was this strange tingling sensation that suddenly crawled underneath his skin, making Elias feel the weight of his decision. What if he was wrong? What if this would seal them all here forever? He glanced at James, whose face was pale with fear but who managed a nod of trust.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No more ghosts,&quot; Elias muttered, steadying his hand. With a deep breath and on the third strike of the pendulum, he pulled the trigger. The gunshot echoed through the room, shattering the canvas in a blink of an eye. For a moment, silence engulfed the room, and Elias stood firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Why did you shoot the canvas?&quot; James wailed. &quot;Now we&#39;re never getting out!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No, James. We are getting out. Da Vinci&#39;s intention in painting the Mona Lisa was to emphasise the beauty and mystery of life, and there appears to be a mistake that seems to oppose the perfect values Da Vinci had imagined,&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What, the Mona Lisa is ugly?&quot; James replied. The Mona Lisa suddenly slipped, falling face first on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, exactly. This isn&#39;t the real world, but rather a manifestation of Da Vinci&#39;s dream,&quot; Elias explained. &quot;These are fragments of his thoughts that have still lingered after his death.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re saying the Mona Lisa is impure and there&#39;s something fucked up about it?&quot; James questioned. The Mona Lisa began to become more transparent by the second. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Remember the flaw you noticed in the painting? That stroke may be the curse itself, the imperfection that haunted him. By breaking down these illusions, we&#39;re dismantling how Da Vinci saw the Mona Lisa after death!&quot; Elias added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa had vanished from existence with no trace left behind. The book monsters fell to the ground, one by one like targets on a shooting range. The curse was slowly fading and so did they too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;His view, poisoned by a single mistake, became a curse. Now that it&#39;s destroyed, people will accept its beauty, and as we return to the present, time will heal the memory of that flaw.&quot; Elias continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait...I think we&#39;re going back! We just lifted the curse!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, we did it. Let&#39;s go!&quot; Elias laughed. The surviving bunch cheered, and then a violent force suddenly tugged on everyone&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait what&#39;s happening?&quot; James screamed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; another commented.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Help!&quot; another added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One by one, they were pulled towards the mysterious portal, with the ground slipping away beneath them. Arms flailed and voices shouted as they struggled against the unseen force. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s our way out! Hold on!&quot; Elias clenched his fists and closed his eyes, hoping for the best and surviving the trip back to reality. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air around them grew thinner by the minute, vibrating with energy as the portal&#39;s centre opened wider, pulsing with a strange, otherworldly light. It swallowed them whole, one by one until only the echo of their voices remained in the space they left behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wake up...&quot; Elias mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh?&quot; James groaned. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You passed out for a good hour...&quot; Elias explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh...&quot; James stood up and gathered his balance with Elias&#39;s help. His hand was back, though the ones that died in that realm were still gone. Elias didn&#39;t think people would die in front of them, yet a ghost appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Guess that&#39;s one case I&#39;ll never forget,&quot; Elias remarked, with a slight smirk on his face. He glanced back at the Mona Lisa, now back to normal and felt finally relieved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite the case being solved, an uneasy feeling entered his mind of a domino effect and a chain of the most bizarre cases ever raised by mankind. Elias stood there and gazed at the painting for a final time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Without warning, a loud bang echoed through the room as the entrance door was flung wide open in a split second. Several armed security men barged into the Louvre, surrounding Elias and the others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Freeze!&quot; the guard shouted. &quot;Who are you all? How did you get in here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait a minute...That painting...It&#39;s back to normal!&quot; another guard exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who did this?&quot; another guard questioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Elias stepped forward with his hands in the pockets of his large navy jacket and began, &quot;Well excuse me men, I did. I&#39;d suppose you&#39;d want to hear the whole story, so, picture this...&quot;</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.eht4ae8qj3vo"><span class="c3">Ajespa&rsquo;s Acrimony</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The stars shone like clusters of crystals in the pitch-black sky, slowly flickering ever so brightly. The midnight scent was fresh, with a hint of rainwater. The breeze gently brushed against her lavender hair, as she walked down the streets of Ajespa, the city that never slept.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ajespa thrived on its nightlife, providing residents with numerous nightclubs, delicious street food vendors, 24/7 arcades, and other amazing services. Along with the serene landscapes and dazzling flowers in the daytime, Ajespa was almost like a fantasy world, lingering with otherworldly atmospheres. Yet, she felt alone in the dream-like city. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The miraculous city built in just 19 years out of nothing was truly a feat for mankind. What started as a mere shelter turned into a vibrant cityscape, with buildings piercing the sky and shops of various goods. But Rae didn&#39;t think much of this feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She trudged along the footpath up towards the mountaintop, climbing towards the peak that loomed over the valley. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah, there you are...Rae Lioni. Your father says dinner is ready...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She silently sat on the cliff&#39;s edge and smiled, unfazed that she was half dangling off the cliff. The view of the valley allowed her to see the suburban areas of the city, where she had come from. The sound of the waterfall beneath her slowly filled the silence as the water rushed out, creating a calming sensation that soothed her mind of all negativities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Barton, why can&#39;t I go explore the world?&quot; Rae began. She toyed with her hair, as the gentle evening breeze sent a cold and fuzzy feeling inside her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, do you keep forgetting? You are the princess of Ajespa, you must continue the legacy...to protect our sacred kingdom!&quot; Barton exclaimed. Rae had nothing to say to Barton&#39;s statement and remained in solitude, listening to the ambience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to go for a walk,&quot; Rae sighed, standing up. &quot;Tell Father that I won&#39;t be there for dinner,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae was alone in such a big city. Even with the most advanced technology, she couldn&#39;t find anyone in person or online who would listen to her or be willing to befriend her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Princess! What are you doing here?&quot; the locals asked as Rae passed the food stalls, down the main road. Rae didn&#39;t reply, for she disliked the amount of publicity she had as the princess. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The streets were busy as usual, the flickering of neon signs and holographic text, igniting the paradise. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Rae couldn&#39;t help to notice one thing; a rather odd symbol almost stamped on all the large cardboard boxes that were filled with goods. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What company is supplying this?&quot; Rae asked a merchant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Great question! I don&#39;t know!&quot; the merchant replied happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Good one! M&#39;lady, the company is called Anateros,&quot; a voice spoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah! Anateros!&quot; the merchant added. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sounds sketchy...&quot; Rae remarked, crossing her arms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you going do? Report us to security? Oh wait...there isn&#39;t any here!&quot; the merchant laughed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, just wait!&quot; Rae snapped, walking away. She grabbed her phone and jumped onto the internet search bar, her fingers frantically typing the words: &quot;Private Investigation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The engine produced millions of results at lightning speed, but one at the top immediately caught her eye. No, there was no mistake. She knew she had been searching bizarre things on the internet but for something to be this personal, Rae knew exactly what the service could do to her. There it was, on the page, the American Supernatural Intelligence Division.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae quickly snapped a few photos of the streets and then rushed home, filling out the form for a case. She had high hopes that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime to find out the secrets that the city had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias Novem was bored. Elias stared at the mundane white ceiling of his apartment, laying on his bed peacefully. The ASID wasn&#39;t kind enough to give Elias many cases, and having a long drought of cases, Elias was ecstatic when his phone vibrated a light green; it signalled to him that Tom had called. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! I&#39;m here to assign you to your next case. Our top detectives are all busy working together on another case; hence we need you to solve this case!&quot; Tom laughed. &quot;It&#39;s in Georgia, we&#39;ll send you the details!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Before Elias could begin and put together his thoughts, Tom had hung up and all Elias could hear was the silent static that rang in his ear. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A red notification bubble suddenly alerted Elias upright once again, with the contents containing a single PDF file. Elias, hesitant to accept the case, opened the file to view the contents.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The file introduced Ajespa, the city of wonder and Elias was hooked immediately. The photos present were bright and colourful, radiating with energy and hinting at an uneasy feeling of modernism. Elias rang Tom again, now standing up and changing into his navy jacket, excited to finally go on a case again. Elias was ready for adventure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Tom demanded with an arrogant tone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;When&#39;s my flight?&quot; Elias questioned, a grin appearing on his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Tomorrow morning, 8 am. Get some rest kid,&quot; Tom replied calmly, then hung up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~ </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias finally reached Ajespa, where the commotion was high, and the mysteries were unsolved. What appeared as mountains to the naked eye, Elias recognised as a complex of mazes, marked by man-made signs that hinted at ancient ruins. He wandered the streets of Ajespa like a boy in a candy store; it was like a dreamland. It was too good to be true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Jeez, who&#39;s the client? And what is this mystery?&quot; Elias thought to himself. Gazing at his surroundings, Elias witnessed several merchant stores and fresh food markets, tucked away in the open ground floor of the towering skyscrapers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Get fresh meat for only 200 Lari!&quot; a vendor announced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are those absurd prices?&quot; Elias commented, throwing his hands up in disbelief. He approached the vendor to confront him about the prices. The vendor was a stout man with a wide grin, wiping his hands on an apron stained from a day&#39;s work. His stall was filled with an array of meats, wrapped in waxy paper, organised neatly into four evenly spaced rows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Two hundred Lari for meat? You do know people aren&#39;t made of money, right?&quot; Elias said, folding his arms as he stared down the merchant. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The merchant didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, he chuckled, looking Elias up and down. &quot;What are you, a foreigner? These prices are normal! We get these quality meats from Anateros!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Anateros?&quot; Elias questioned. &quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t even know of Anateros?&quot; the vendor scoffed, leaning forward. He stared down Elias, sending a terrible shiver down his spine that spooked him to the core. The vendor pointed towards the machine in the back, specifically at the logo that was engraved into the machine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The structure was composed of two triangular shapes: a small, compact one and a tall, slender one, arranged side-by-side to convey strength and precision. &quot;Let me give you a quick history lesson, newbie. Anateros is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and they are the cornerstone of this city. Without them, we would be broken into pieces!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias sighed, turned away, and trudged down the bustling streets, only to notice the same logo everywhere he went. It was stuck in his head, with the imbalance of symmetry sparking new ideas in his head. Was this company the cornerstone of the city? What are their true motivations? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Anateros...sounds Greek-ish...&quot; Elias mumbled, focusing on his thoughts. Elias was lost in his logic and kept walking forward, slowly losing focus on his way forward and tilting his head down to concentrate. The rhythmic beat of his footsteps only helped him sink deeper into his tangled state of mind, with his eyes tracing the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When the sudden ambience of his footsteps stopped abruptly, Elias felt a strong impact on his body, pushing him backwards. He found himself face-to-face with someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, quickly passing by Elias. Elias was wonderstruck. That lavender hair and that scarlet silk dress were an enchanting sight for Elias. He had first not seen a woman that beautiful in his life, and second of all, it came to his realisation that she was the princess of Ajespa, the heir to the throne, part of the royal family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait a moment!&quot; Elias shouted, quickly turning around. The girl froze and looked behind her to see Elias gazing deep into her eyes. A warm sensation coursed through her, and a mysterious aura drew her closer to Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;My name is Elias Novem, pleased to meet you, princess,&quot; Elias began. &quot;I&#39;ve been tasked by someone from this city for a private investigation?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re the one they sent?&quot; the princess stumbled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I have been tasked by the American Supernatural Intelligence Division to come investigate the city of Ajespa,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Please call me Rae,&quot; Rae replied. &quot;And I was the one who asked you to come...there&#39;s been a lot happening recently...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read on the news...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Follow me. I want to show you something...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae ascended the mountain along the footpath to Ajespan Manor, the royal family&#39;s estate. The garden was beautiful, especially during the evening as the sun had cast long beams of light that emphasised the colours of the flowers. The moment Elias stepped into the manor, an unseen, majestic energy enveloped him. It was a mystical aura that filled his mind with wonder. The interior was quite spacious and grandeur, although not matching the futuristic style of the rest of the city, it was littered with vintage items and paintings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Your father is sick Rae. And who&#39;s this fine gentleman?&quot; the butler asked from the second floor, spotting Rae and Elias entering the manor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I made a friend, Barton!&quot; Rae exclaimed. Elias was confused, as he was only just a detective on a case and didn&#39;t consider himself a friend of Rae, especially when he knew that she didn&#39;t have any friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I see...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;His name is Elias...Would father mind if he stayed for the night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh well, I suppose. After all, I&#39;m just a butler, following your father&#39;s orders,&quot; Barton explained. Soon after, he left the room, leaving Elias and Rae alone in the manor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to first change out of this dress, it&#39;s a mess,&quot; Rae smiled as she slipped into her room, changing into something more comfortable. It wasn&#39;t long until she was back out and ready to show Elias the bizarre tunnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, um,&quot; Rae mumbled, swaying from left to right. Elias immediately knew she was quite nervous, slowly moving towards the left side of the manor as if she were trying to direct him. He casually followed Rae&#39;s lead towards a locked door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Since I was young, my dad has never let me through this door. I&#39;ve been so curious for the past few years, so I&#39;ve tried many times, but I&#39;ve been caught,&quot; Rae explained as she picked the lock on the door. Elias watched with worry as he knew if one&#39;s daughter was picking a lock, it was not a good sign of the future. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, this is the perfect time! Father is sick so we can explore where the door leads. I need help solving this mystery. I can&#39;t do it alone; I need someone smart like you!&quot; Rae smiled, opening the door as she finished her last words. &quot;There! Let&#39;s go...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they stepped inside, a heavy but gentle gust of air brushed their cheeks, sending a chilling sensation down their spines. Each step they took sent an uneasy tingling feeling into their bodies as the hallway became narrower, they went down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at these carvings...&quot; Elias whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I know right? It&#39;s so magical!&quot; Rae replied, giggling a little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The passageway began to slope downward, subtly at first, then more pronounced, and the air grew colder still. Rae saw it first; the hallway had ended right beneath their feet, and it marked the entrance of the dungeons. The sound of dripping water suddenly began echoing from above and Elias almost immediately spotted bones, giving him the chills.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This is ancient Georgia, eh?&quot; Elias remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I believe so. This is so cool!&quot; Rae smiled. Soon, they reached an intersection with two doors on either side of the hallway. The left door, forbidding entry with a stern &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign, was firmly locked. However, the right door, bare of any warning, was not locked. Rae slowly pushed the door on the right open and revealed the ominous interior.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room was hollowed out, stretching to the vast size of the mountain&#39;s interior. Inside, nine giant mutant-like robots were neatly organised into a three-by-three grid, each looking like they were built yesterday. There were computers, and tools that lay around on the ground, scattered like a mad sea. Rae and Elias were both frozen in motion, like a stone statue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias had read stories of long-lost technologies, but to see them here, in the catacombs of Georgia, silent and unmoving, was surreal. Each robot loomed over him like a metal sentinel, waiting in eternal slumber. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae approached the robot and reached out, her fingers grazing the cold silver. It felt almost alive as if she were touching something ancient, forbidden. Elias moved beside her, his eyes wide with fear and awe. For a moment, neither of them spoke. There was an unseen magical force that suddenly pressed against them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The emptiness of the room seemed to breathe around them, shadows shifting as the faint glow of their flashlights skimmed across hulking metal figures. Although there were nine robots in the room, each of them seemed to be gigantic, roughly about eight times larger than a normal human. They were all encased in layers of silver plating, still shining like it was polished a minute ago. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias carefully weaved through the robots, his hand brushing the cold metal of a robot&#39;s arm. The bulky arms of the robots were cold and hard, knocking them sent a low vibration that echoed through the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Rae took an unconscious step back, the awe in her eyes mingling with a trace of fear. Rae was lost in her thoughts as she gazed at the huge robots. She closely inspected them and found guns attached to their backs and more firearms mounted into their arms. Rae began finding the robots more like war robots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias quickly scanned the room as he reached the other end and approached a small table in the corner. He began searching the tabletop, reaching for the opened book that lay flat on the table, flipping through its contents. He used his phone as an aid to translate passages to help him understand. The task was arduous, and Elias was devoted to learning something new about the mystery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, footsteps echoed down the narrow needle-like hallways of the catacombs, slowly forming an ominous atmosphere cloaked with mystery. Elias quickly snapped photos of the pages and stood beside Rae.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are we going to do now?&quot; Rae asked. &quot;What if they come here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;There!&quot; Elias murmured sharply, with his finger pointing to a small, unassuming wooden door hidden in the shadows at the far end of the room. Without hesitation, the two sprinted across the room towards the door, tugging it open and slipping inside before quickly pulling it shut behind them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The footsteps grew louder as the mysterious figure entered the room, now scanning the area. Rae carefully leaned back and gently pressed against Elias&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Elias whispered, wrapping his hand around Rae&#39;s body as he tried to steady his heartbeat. She nodded, exhaling in relief as they stood perfectly still.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph,&quot; the figure muttered in a frustrated tone. They then marched out of the room. Elias peered through the cracks, catching a glimpse of the figure as he left. He identified the figure as a tall, thin man in a dark shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae struggled for a while but slowly managed to crawl out of the cramped storage room. The two gathered all the information and headed out of the devilish room of robots, and back into the tunnels of the catacombs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go back,&quot; Rae mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hang on, I need to check something. Go on ahead without me, I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; Elias motioned as he approached the locked door. Rae quickly moved on by herself while Elias inspected the &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign much closer, and quickly realised the passkey to the lock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias had realised the combination was a 4-digit code and figured that the number of strokes each word had must have related to the password. Elias quickly counted the strokes and swiftly dialled the code &#39;4616&#39; into the rusty lock. The lock was uneasy to configure, with the numbers getting stuck easily but Elias powered through, and finally, the door magically opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias gently leaned against the door and carefully pushed it open, unveiling an egg-like capsule in the middle of the room. His gaze fell upon a tattered book page, discarded on the floor. The remaining words displayed:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;For he searched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The essence of the.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And we did advance like.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cultivating technology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Burned us together;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias thought hard, ultimately resulting in him snapping a photo and leaving, not wanting anything to happen to Rae. Elias quickly rushed out of the room and realised Rae was long gone and was out of his sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae!&quot; Elias called out, echoing through the tunnels. Elias gracefully found his way out, back into the manor. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Looking for the girl, Novem?&quot; a voice crackled. Elias turned to see the man approaching him in his adorned black suit, walking with fashion towards him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You...You aren&#39;t a royal...You&#39;re just a butler!&quot; Elias started, jerking backwards and positioning himself into a better stance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course, the Royal Family are just puppets of mine. This city, what you are seeing is just a fraction of my wealth!&quot; the butler laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Anateros is where I&#39;ll start disassembling your wealth,&quot; Elias snapped, slowly backing away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh? Getting your hopes up high, I see.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I already know everything!&quot; Elias exclaimed. &quot;This is just the beginning, and I will take you down...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias pushed the doors open of the manor and stepped outside, finally able to catch his breath. He sighed a deep sigh of relief and quickly regained his energy, then stood up and read over his notes again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Opening his notes app, Elias carefully analysed his findings. &quot;Strange robots are hidden in catacombs. According to history, in 1551, the Persians invaded Vardzia, where Ajespa stood. Unless the Georgians had hidden something here...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A sudden realisation ignited in Elias&#39;s mind as if a match had struck him aflame. Returning to the passage, Elias finally deciphered its meaning, discovering that the Georgians had hidden a treasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Now if I can just find Rae...&quot; Elias muttered, contemplating whether he should barge back into the manor. Elias decided to play it cool and waited, hiding in the nearby bushes. Soon enough the butler stepped outside the manor, checking his surroundings then jumping into a car.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go to Vroti Tower,&quot; the butler commanded. The chauffeur nodded, starting the car. As he drove, Elias strained to hear the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias arrived at the tower soon after, holding a sinking feeling throughout his journey. The tower certainly felt like a trap and Elias was weary of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Help me...&quot; a voice rang. A slight tapping of glass echoed from above, followed by a sudden static whirring noise alarmed Elias, who jolted backwards at the flickering of the screen. The massive screen in the lobby suddenly turned on, with the butler&#39;s face on it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello Novem, looks like fate called upon us again. What a sneaky little rat you are!&quot; the butler laughed. &quot;So, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve seen the War robots, eh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Elias sputtered, reassembling his thoughts completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Those robots underground, in the catacombs! Don&#39;t lie, I can smell that scent from you! They will soon rise and help Anateros become a more powerful company!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;So, I assumed...&quot; Elias smirked, grinning. He was unfazed by the impending doom and pieced together the puzzle in his mind, now with his logic all cleared and actions unclouded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha! As if you&#39;re a superhero!&quot; the butler laughed hysterically. He quickly turned off the camera that displayed his face and switched it to a different view of two cameras pointing at two distinct subjects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I know you&#39;ve come to like the royal, so let&#39;s play a game, Novem,&quot; the butler giggled. The screen was split into two, with the first camera pointing towards Rae, being tied up by the hands. The camera panned down, pointing towards Elias who gazed up and saw Rae just a few floors above him. The other camera pointed towards a big red button, and the butler soon entered the frame. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The girl? Or will you save the city? This button awakens my newest creations!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias hesitated, not knowing which option to choose. He knew he couldn&#39;t be the hero and perform both tasks; No, it was either Rae or the city. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Too late!&quot; the butler yelled. &quot;Cut it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A man swiftly cut the rope holding Rae up and she began falling. Then, the butler slammed the button hard with his fist. Elias didn&#39;t have a choice but to save Rae. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias gracefully caught Rae as she descended, falling and hitting hard on his arms. &quot;Oof! Are you alright?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Argh, I&#39;m fine...&quot; Rae groaned. Rae got on her feet again and Elias helped her out of the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A deafening whirring sound began to stir up as they stepped foot outside the Vroti Tower and what the two saw shocked them. The ground, the streets, and the land began to split in half and open into a giant enormous cave underneath them, unveiling a giant army of metal war robots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Behold! The creations of the wisest civilisation, the Georgians! Bring me power, war robots!&quot; the butler shouted as he stood on the top floor of the Vroti tower. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Barton Colerico...&quot; Rae muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s his name?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No wonder...That man has been America&#39;s most wanted for decades now...appearing on hundreds of headlines...&quot; Elias explained. &quot;He is a true mastermind...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Barton&#39;s laughter echoed through the tower, Rae&#39;s heart began to pound faster, matching the rhythm of the chaos surrounding her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The robots suddenly produced a deep and ominous grunt, shaking the very Earth and scaring the residents. The robots began hunting the residents like tiny ants, stomping on them and destroying nearby buildings; all but except the Vroti Tower.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae, we need to move!&quot; Elias&#39;s voice was strained, but she hesitated, glancing back at Barton. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Try to run! It will not be much longer until I gain control of the world!&quot; Barton roared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae gripped Elias&#39;s hand tightly, and together, they dashed for the exit as the ground trembled. Metal fragments sprayed past them, a relentless wave of heat and force. Rae stumbled, her chest heaving, each step pulling her farther from the only life she had ever known and closer to an uncertain future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Aaah!&quot; Rae screamed as an arm flailed across her eyes. The war robots slowly awakened, their mechanical limbs creaking as they rose to infest the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;To the castle!&quot; Elias shouted as he found an empty car parked on the side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you even know how to drive?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Relax! I got my licence 3 months ago!&quot; Surprisingly, no war robots attempted to get in Elias&#39;s way, and they casually made it to the castle without any incidents. The war robots acted as if there was a repellent on them, guiding them away from him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This is so strange...&quot; Elias remarked, looking back down at the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae! There you are!&quot; a voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Dad? You&#39;re awake?&quot; Rae stuttered, unable to piece her words together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;There&#39;s something I need to tell you. I always knew this day would come; I didn&#39;t expect it to arrive so soon. It&#39;s the end of the world...&quot; Rae&#39;s father began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What is it, Dad? Dad? Randall?&quot; Rae asked, now extremely eager.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m not your father. And I can&#39;t say if you are adopted or not...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae&#39;s heart suddenly skipped a beat. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen! After the fateful invasion in 1551, my family was tasked to guard and research the area. We&#39;ve been the guardians of this place. After discovering the war robots, we wanted to restore them to see what they could do. But none of us were capable. That&#39;s why, 31 years ago we asked mastermind Barton Colerico to help us fix these robots.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I get it!&quot; Elias interrupted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;He said it would cost a fortune to fix...&quot; Randall continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And that&#39;s why Ajespa&#39;s merchants have such overpriced goods! They must all be working for Anateros!&quot; Elias realised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Correct. For you Rae, Barton found you in a peculiar egg hidden away in the depths of the catacombs...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Dad...I...&quot; Rae began, panicking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Elias whispered, placing his hand on her shoulder, trying to calm her down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&quot;He brought you here, and we took care of you. We didn&#39;t know what to do with you, so we just cared for you...Oh, now we left Barton in charge of the robots...We strayed too far, and he took control...How foolish I am...&quot; Randall </span><span>sighed</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re missing something...&quot; Elias hesitated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If Rae was found in the catacombs, and was in that egg thing...She has been alive for over 3 centuries...The Georgians were known for their wisdom, and after what I saw of the egg, it&#39;s like a cryonic device, allowing Rae to be transferred to the future...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Randall interrupted, now intrigued. He gazed into Elias&#39;s midnight black eyes, flawlessly deciphering the century-long mystery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m saying Rae is a descendant of the Georgians and could have the ability to control the robots. Think about it! Their wisdom rivals modern technology. Who knows if they have voice commands or something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, try it! You must help us stop this madness Barton is doing!&quot; Randall begged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The truth is, Rae is technically the queen of Georgia. If I&#39;m not wrong, the war robots were supposed to be designed as bodyguards that would protect her and free her from her century-long cryofreeze, but they were never finished. Instead, Barton had continued the Persian&#39;s work, freed Rae and altered the robots&#39; code.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ok...okay...&quot; Rae replied, catching her breath. Rae&#39;s heart hammered in her chest at a high tempo, with the echo of the beat seeming louder than the mechanical hum surrounding her. How were these machines supposed to be bodyguards? Rae felt the heavy weight of burdens the Georgians carried on her shoulders, as if her ancestors watched, waiting to see what the future queen would do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae looked down at her hands, then at Elias&#39;s eyes. Again, she saw only death in his eyes, but she knew that he had something special about him. Rae had never felt anything like this, and trusting in Elias was something hard for her to swallow. She quickly directed her attention back towards the robots and inhaled deeply, channelling her strength from a place she didn&#39;t know existed, and prepared to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To their surprise, there was a long delay, then silence. The city fell quiet, and the robots stopped the loud whirring noise and froze in motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What? What happened?&quot; Barton exclaimed in utter disbelief, leaning over the edge of the Vroti tower to see the chaos unfold. &quot;Why did they stop?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey Rae, what if you asked them to get Barton Colerico?&quot; Elias suggested, smiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae blushed, nodded and went through with Elias&#39;s idea. Again, shouting at the top of her lungs, Rae commanded the robots. &quot;Get me Barton Colerico!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The robots scanned the area, finding Barton Colerico. The closest robot leaned down towards Barton and plucked him like a cherry. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Let go of me! Argh!&quot; Barton squirmed. The machine marched towards Rae and threw him in front of her. This was a miraculous moment as peace and silence engulfed the whole city. Barton sprawled at Rae&#39;s feet, his expression twisting between anger and shock. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ugh...screw your royalty! I knew I shouldn&#39;t have freed you from that stupid egg...&quot; Barton whimpered as he struggled to get up, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re coming with me back to the States, buddy. You got a $500 million bounty on your head!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You think I&#39;m going down that easily?&quot; Barton laughed with his last breath. Then, like a cruel twist of fate, his hand slipped to his jacket, pulling out the small device as his lips curled into a smirk. &quot;You may have solved this case, but it will cost you your life...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was a very subtle beeping sound at first, with Elias not even noticing. The sound gradually grew louder and louder until Rae heard it and pulled Elias towards her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A thunderous roar, hellish red fire and chunks of metal began spewing everywhere and one by one, the robots began to detonate, erupting and breaking apart. There was nothing but explosions. Rae, Elias, and Randall barely had time to dive for cover as the force of the explosions had sent large chunks of debris sky-high, piercing the ground as they came flying down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Larry! Bring down the chopper! Get me out of here!&quot; Barton yelled into his earpiece.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias, Rae and Randall ran for cover as Barton ran towards the cliff&#39;s edge, swiftly jumping on the helicopter his men were piloting. &quot;We&#39;ll meet again, Elias!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias gave Barton a dirty look as he ran for cover. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The three quickly made their way to the manor&#39;s walls, estimating it was probably the safest place to take cover. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Elias&#39;s phone rang. Elias picked up the phone as he watched the city skyline crumble, each tower and building slowly disintegrating right in front of him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Novem, this is Sylvester from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division! I&#39;ve picked up some unusual activity near your location. Where on earth did Tom send you this time? Do you need a ride back? It looks like you are in a nuke zone now,&quot; the agent warned, his voice laced with urgency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, and please hurry up!&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yep! We have a speed jet on its way from Zestafoni that landed for a research project a couple of hours ago. It&#39;ll be there in about 5 minutes!&quot; The line hung up and Elias cleaned up his thoughts, thinking of what to do next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;At least the city of lies is gone...&quot; Randall smiled as the city slowly crumbled, leaving only the ancient natural terrain behind. He leant against the brick wall of the manor, as a tear fell from his eyes. &quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes Dad, I love you...&quot; Rae cried, holding him tight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae darling...I think it&#39;s time you left the chains Vardzia and Georgia hold you...I know you aren&#39;t capable of this position, and I think everyone should learn the true history of the Georgians, here in Vardzia. It&#39;s time for you to explore the world. Who knows what you&#39;ll encounter?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Really?&quot; Rae sniffed. She couldn&#39;t hold her tears back anymore and started weeping, crying on her old man&#39;s shoulder. She looked into his eyes, the familiar kindness and strength that had always anchored her, and for a moment, the weight she carried faded. Randall smiled and kissed her on the forehead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, Barton has only been feeding you lies. The world now is so much better than it was 3 centuries ago. It&#39;s okay, I have always loved you,&quot; Randall smiled, his eyes softening. &quot;You were always destined for more, Rae. Vardzia may be your birthplace, but the world beyond awaits you. Go live it fully, for me, for your ancestors. Elias will help you; he seems like such a sweet boy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Randall!&quot; another voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Maria! Come on, hurry! You&#39;re going to die!&quot; Randall shouted. &quot;C&#39;mon, I promise we&#39;ll be here the next time you visit Rae. Your mother and I will always be here. Now go!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae glanced back one last time at the city skyline. She had been a victim of her legacy, but now she was free. With a final breath, she turned away from the city and stepped forward, embracing the world that waited beyond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go. The plane is here...We don&#39;t want to miss it...&quot; Elias motioned. Rae nodded, gave her father a final goodbye kiss, and then walked away. She followed closely with Elias, running towards the plane without looking back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess this is Ajespa&#39;s Acrimony...&quot; Randall laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;At least it&#39;s over and history is history,&quot; Maria added. The plane quickly took off and Rae was gone, with Elias to explore the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you want to do first?&quot; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&quot;I don&#39;t know, you&#39;re the expert! You tell me!&quot; Rae laughed as she rested her head on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias looked out the window and took a sigh of relief, with the case finally being closed. He also knew that Barton and Anateros were far from being out of business.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.js62dd2b429"><span class="c3">Roots of Airiman</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The static of his laptop quietly hummed in the background. Elias was once again, working tirelessly through the night on a report. He sat at his desk beside his dim lamp and was still tapping on the keys of his keyboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The American Supernatural Intelligence Division was not lenient on any tasks. They had a strict and tight schedule, and Elias was not one of those members to stray from these rules. No, he was not anywhere near the top detectives in the division. He had only had a few encounters, and his last was nothing of a small feat, but rather a big one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wanted to prove himself capable of taking on a higher position. Then, muffled footsteps echoed down the hallway outside, growing louder by the second. The door slowly creaked open. Through the small opening, a voice weakly whispered through. &quot;Why are you still up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Not now Rae...I&#39;m almost done...&quot; Elias replied as he stood up. Rae pushed the door open and entered Elias&#39;s room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias, when are you going to go to bed...?&quot; Rae asked, rubbing her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias sighed, leaning back. &quot;I can&#39;t rest until I&#39;ve finished writing this report. It&#39;s important, it&#39;s about your case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;My case...&quot; Rae began, playing with her lavender hair. She didn&#39;t know what to say, but it was important. Rae was unlike others, but her mystique was enchanting in a way that Elias couldn&#39;t deny. Although there was a much more complicated background, it was only Elias who was nice enough to accompany her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;ll only take about 5 more minutes...&quot; Elias reassured, with Rae watching eagerly at the screen as Elias typed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...Just get some rest...Don&#39;t worry about it too much...&quot; Rae smiled. She leaned down a little and gave Elias a big cuddle. Elias took his hands off the keyboard and gently squeezed her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You have one new notification!&quot; a robotic voice alerted. Elias directed his sight back to the screen and opened his email inbox. At the very top, a new email appeared with the subject titled: &quot;Highly Classified&quot;. Elias opened the email and it read:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&#39;Dear Mr. Elias Novem,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Is this a good time? My name is Tristan Kniet, and I desperately need your help. Do you know of the Airiman&#39;s Essence?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence...&quot; Elias hesitated, then added, &quot;It&#39;s an old legend from the Indigenous tribes here. They spoke of a spirit-I can&#39;t remember what it is exactly. I just know that my professor said it was a way for the land to speak to those who don&#39;t belong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae shivered. &quot;And this random guy wants your help?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yep,&quot; Elias smiled, pushing away from Rae&#39;s embrace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, yes. Now can you go to bed?&quot; Rae said, impatiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, night,&quot; Elias motioned, leading Rae out and kissing her. The morning sun soon rose and the sunlight gently submerged the living room with a warm, soft light. Rae was still sound asleep whilst Elias was again, up first making breakfast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Morning Rae,&quot; Elias comforted, gently tapping Rae on her shoulder. &quot;Wake up!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ugh...What time is it?&quot; Rae groaned as she rubbed her eyes. &quot;How come you sleep so late and still be able to wake up so early?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s only 9:00 am, not even that early!&quot; Elias laughed, sitting down beside Rae, on her bed. &quot;My Professor is only free at 10:00 am so we better hurry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae soon arrived at the small, cosy apartment block on 81 Welster Street, where Elias&#39;s professor had resided. Elias stepped up to the grandeur-looking entrance on the third floor and knocked on the professor&#39;s door. There was no answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe he&#39;s still asleep...&quot; Rae implied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias ignored her and knocked slightly harder. Slightly annoyed, Elias reached into his pockets, eventually finding two small keys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Which one do you think fits?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm? Neither matches the keyhole..?&quot; Rae asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re right, you need both keys...&quot; Elias demonstrated as he pieced together the keys in a specific way and gracefully unlocked the door, slowly pushing it open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias carefully crossed the kitchen and approached his professor&#39;s study room, located on the far right side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Professor?&quot; Elias exclaimed, peeping his head inside. Instead of seeing the professor sitting upright at his desk, he was nowhere to be seen. It was a Saturday and normally, the professor would either be still asleep or at his desk working on lectures or marking papers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead of the presence of the professor, a curious-looking box sat sealed shut on his table. Elias carefully picked the box up and inspected it and found an engraving carved into the underside of the box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Box of Dreams&quot; Elias read, putting it back down. His curiosity soon reached him and Elias couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. He wanted to open the box to see what was inside. He slid the lid off and the box was empty. Nothing was inside. Elias was confused. What had happened to his professor?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Looking for more answers, Elias found another box, assuming it was the packaging for the smaller wooden box that had mysteriously killed the professor. On it read an address, from the Northern Territory of Australia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Fuck this, I&#39;m not getting paid enough...&quot; Elias sighed as he stormed outside and booked a plane ticket. Rae heard Elias march out and quickly followed behind, racing down the stairs outside the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I need to go to Australia. I&#39;ll be back in a week.&quot; Elias explained. &quot;Look after yourself...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias held a worried look and quickly jumped into his car and drove off to the airport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey wait a minute! You can&#39;t just leave me here!&quot; Rae yelled, but it was no use. Elias had sped off as if he was more concerned about his professor and not Rae.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae was furious, but it didn&#39;t tangle her logic as her mind remained rational and calm. Rae quickly made her way back home then packed some necessities and headed towards the airport, buying a ticket herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Australian air clung thick and hot. It was warmer than Elias and Rae had both thought, reaching up to temperatures of 32&#8304;C. The airport had a fresh minty aroma that made the surrounding barren desert feel modern and crispier. Elias squinted into the sun as he stepped out into the desolate terrain, feeling a sense of displacement as if the land was vibrating beneath his feat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias soon arrived at the location, a remote town nearing the centre of Australia. He checked in at a nearby hotel. The hotel was simple and old, to say the least, for it to look abandoned in the small town located in the empty desert was nothing new.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae on the other hand was behind, approximately by 8 hours or so. Rae found her way into Australia the next morning, in search of Elias. She didn&#39;t have any information on where he had gone, and she knew that this was also her mission to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soon, Rae found a local hotel near Darwin. She knew she wanted to have some fun and explore what the isolated city of Darwin had to offer before she began her proper quest to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day 1: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias woke to the radio&#39;s dull chatter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; The voice droned on, static crackling slightly, an odd hiccup in the broadcast. He rolled his eyes, annoyed by the noise and turned it off without a second thought. Elias decided to explore the hotel and wandered into the mess of a dining hall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...Elias...&quot; a voice rang as Elias ate his food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias jerked around, looking around to find nobody. Then there was the tingling sensation that sent chills down Elias&#39;s spine as Elias for once in his life, felt afraid, and that someone was there to hunt him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias quickly finished his meal and left the hotel, heading out to the site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t remember me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Um, ok? I mean, my name is Tristan Kniet after all. I guess you&#39;re only trying to help me...Unless you can solve this stupid mystery, you can&#39;t kindly leave me be,&quot; Tristan explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s the mystery?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that...&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What about it?&quot; Elias questioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, every day they appear and surround the town.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Then how did I get here at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know. They would stop at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes? And? What are you implying?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know how to get out...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Get out of what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This town! I arrived last week, and ever since then, I&#39;ve been stuck here! I&#39;ve been paying absurd amounts of money to the hotel!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, can&#39;t you just make a call or something?&quot; Elias suggested, taking his phone out. As he tried to open his networking app, a red alert displayed the two words that shook Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;NO SIGNAL&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh. How did you send that email of yours though?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Like I said, I haven&#39;t sent an email!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If you&#39;re gonna be like that, I&#39;m just going to leave,&quot; Elias replied, now frustrated again. He couldn&#39;t believe a client who emailed him didn&#39;t even know that he emailed him. As he walked through the town, he witnessed a man getting hit by a ball that some kids were playing with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias tried to navigate through the dust storms, he could barely see and was forced to turn back. Still, Elias was determined to leave the town. He waited until the storms had calmed down. During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange that burnt the sandy terrain. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias ventured to the outskirts of the town. It was cold and dark outside, making this task quite difficult. Elias didn&#39;t give in though, for he explored quite far before he saw it. It wasn&#39;t a mere hallucination but strange beasts suddenly started to creep out from the bushes and startled Elias. He had never seen animals this large that loomed over him like towers. He felt vulnerable and was terrified. He had never seen anything like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Those are megafauna, kid. That&#39;s the Diprotodon in front of you...&quot; a man laughed. Elias didn&#39;t find it funny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You can see it?&quot; Elias screamed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Obviously!&quot; the man laughed again. &quot;I&#39;d advise you to stay in this town. There are quite some scary monsters out there!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Elias screamed again. He suddenly realised why Kniet did not know how to escape. The town was cursed, somehow. Elias quickly made his way back into his room and passed the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; the other broadcaster suddenly stuttered, as if the radio had glitched some sort. &quot;-we&#39;ll be continuing with dust storms in the afternoon,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias, frustrated, got up and turned the radio off. He was in a bad mood, and the radio only worsened it. It was like the radio was emitting deafening sound waves into his mind, vibrating so heavily that it gave him a headache.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it. However, as Elias was eating the food, he felt like he had eaten this type of food before, even though he had never been to Australia, nor had he had any authentic Australian experiences back in the States like this. Something felt off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Elias finished his meal, he felt a sense of deja vu, but nothing clicked in his head. The subtle feeling kicked his mind awake, but yet he could not recall anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias Novem&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That name rings a bell...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Um, ok?

Elias laughed again with the man as if it felt natural. But it didn&#39;t feel normal. Each day felt so surreal as if it was repeating. Was he in Groundhog Day?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quiet radio static turned into a deafening machine, alerting Elias out of his sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The broadcaster&#39;s voice sounded bizarrely similar, with the same sarcastic tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; the voice announced as if it were reading off a script. Elias froze. A cold unease settled in his chest. Elias didn&#39;t think again and threw the radio against the wall; he was frustrated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias wasn&#39;t hungry so he skipped breakfast. Instead, he headed immediately towards the site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet? Are you trying to get out this time of day, again?&quot; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;My name is Elias Novem. I was tasked by someone to help you...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Great! So, how do we get rid of that thing?&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; Elias explained. Elias&#39;s muscle memory had somehow kicked in and had overrode his actions. Elias was spitting everything out to his instinct&#39;s desire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange, again. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended. Elias this time was aware and his body controlled his navigation systems, rerouting him to venture to a darker part of the town.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm...&quot; a man mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias began. He crossed his arms and sternly looked at the man who was sitting on the wooden crates, holding a strange device.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. But this isn&#39;t the solution you&#39;re looking for...&quot; the man hissed, with his words almost being inaudible. Elias flinched then he saw darkness. The man had knocked Elias out cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; Elias jumped out of his bed and threw the radio across the room, annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The day felt repeated, with Elias remembering some things he did. But he knew something now. Before he left the hotel, Elias quickly snuck a pen and notepad into his jacket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Throughout the day, Elias jotted everything down, allowing him to remember clearly. He knew something was odd about his thoughts and knew his logic was clouded by some strange unknown force. He wanted to test a theory as he knew there was something strange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias again, found himself nearing the alleyway again that evening, passing by the same man he encountered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Standing a safe distance, Elias sketched out the strange device the man held and quickly tucked his notepad back into his jacket. The man was unfazed and did not notice Elias&#39;s presence. He sat there, using the device like a cigarette.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He quickly escaped the scene, going back to his hotel room and calling it a night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day 5: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was once again startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, Elias didn&#39;t even wait. Before the announcer could say a word, Elias had hurled the radio across the room, smashing it against the wall. &#39;Shut up!&#39; he yelled, gasping as the eerie sensation of deja vu washed over him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias put his jacket on, a piece of paper that was placed inside his jacket slipped out. What was this? Elias had never seen this paper before. He picked it up in confusion and saw impossible-looking sketches. Then, he found a notepad lodged in the other pocket of his jacket. When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram. It seemed to Elias to be some kind of map. Elias went to the marked spot at 17:30 and found it to be empty. However, just as Elias was about to leave, a man walked by.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh? How did you get here?!&quot; the man exclaimed. The man was in terror and fell backwards, dropping a strange device. Elias quickly peeked at the notepad and realised the device looked strangely similar to the object sketched. Elias dove for the device and snatched it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No!&quot; the man yelled. His voice grew in anger as he jumped towards Elias, trying to take the device back. Elias quickly dodged the man attempting to attack him and safely stood up with the device in his hands. &quot;You mustn&#39;t use it! You will die!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Me? Die?&quot; Elias questioned. He had felt like he had died multiple times now, reliving the same day. Elias toyed around with the device and suddenly started it. It began shooting out a strange yellow gas that quickly spread around. He didn&#39;t know how to stop it, but it began to grow larger and larger, spreading throughout the town. Elias inhaled the gas, taking a big breath in. It was a dangerous move, but he knew something about this device was letting this mysterious man remember and not be affected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You idiot!&quot; the man yelled. He jumped up and attacked Elias. Again, Elias swiftly dodged his attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop lying. I think I know what&#39;s up now,&quot; Elias explained. The man froze in motion, eyes widening in terror. &quot;My memories...Or should I say the town&#39;s memories? They are getting reset each night...Time still moves normally, it&#39;s just our memories are wiped so our minds think we haven&#39;t moved forward&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And? Your current memories will just reset tomorrow morning! You can&#39;t do anything!&quot; the man laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Really, Tristan Kniet? You think that this is going to work?&quot; Elias mumbled. &quot;I know this town well enough now. You used the only computer in this town to send that email and pretended to lose your memories. That device you dropped, kills this drug. I remember clearly now. It all makes sense.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No, this can&#39;t be!&quot; Tristan exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Firstly, the megafauna are all just mere illusions. They are centuries old and they cannot possibly come back to life. Secondly, you said to me to help get rid of those dust storms. How can one stop a dust storm? There are so many more flaws that give this hoax away. You are riddled with chaos...&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I-&quot; Tristan croaked. &quot;Maybe...Just maybe I needed you to help free me from my madness. I discovered this drug and I almost died...and I wanted to show the world...but this cycle...the antidote...the money...it all sounded too good...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m betting you, Anateros is behind this, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Elias laughed. Tristan suddenly fell to his knees, gasping for air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;How... how did you know?&quot; Tristan choked. The air grew thin for Tristan, and without the antidote, the drug quickly seeped through the ground into his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His smile faded from a sinister grin and slowly formed an expression of despair, begging for the antidote. &quot;They tricked me! Please...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias frowned, his grip tightening on the antidote. &quot;You&#39;re pathetic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tristan let out a weak laugh, his voice hollow. &quot;They paid me so much...to lure you...to get rid of you...But it didn&#39;t work out...Our plans were rushed...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Elias threw the device and it shattered into pieces, the antidote scattering everywhere. The gas slowly </span><span>sifted</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;into the ground, destroying some of the drug.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re an archaeologist. Enlighten me.&quot; Elias ordered. &quot;This drug needs to be exterminated, and investigated further,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias helped Tristan stand up, knowing that his motives were purely driven by Anateros&#39;s corrupt organisation, manipulating his actions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, I admit defeat. You&#39;ve bested me, Novem. This town once was the Airiman&#39;s villa, an Indigenous Tribe. They found these strange roots in South Australia and brought them up north to plant. What they didn&#39;t know was that it was actually a deadly drug that when planted in the wrong conditions, has severe aftereffects. We&#39;ve all experienced it. Hallucinations and memory loss.&quot; Tristan explained. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have more of the antidote,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;How do I get out of here?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, leave. Leave me alone in this town now,&quot; Tristan mumbled as he handed Elias a pair of keys and a capsule filled with the antidote. &quot;Use the antidote like a cigarette...One puff will last around 2 hours. Good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I have one more question,&quot; Elias smiled, his midnight black eyes widening. The look of death stared Tristan down, sending a terrifying chill down his spine that shook his entire body. &quot;How much work did you go into buying new radios and repairing the wall every night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tristan was in denial. How had he messed it up so badly? Then, Tristan remembered. His memories began to appear clearer than ever before, recalling back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;They were Anateros men. Two remained here, always, with protective gear. Go now before they come looking for me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This time, Elias was surprised, with his mouth hanging open. Anateros had not only been manipulating Tristan, but it was their discovery. Elias turned around and ran towards the old car.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias got a signal, he checked his phone. 10 missed calls from Rae. 64 missed calls from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. He had messed up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Back in Darwin, Rae had spent the past two weeks living off of Elias&#39;s credit card. Elias had completely lost track of time. He had spent countless days putting everything together and when he checked his balance, he was $10,000 in debt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae was quite literally having some of the best time in her life, being free and exploring new places. In just two weeks, she had bought various expensive clothes, tasted numerous mouth-watering foods and enjoyed many fun activities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was all about to end. Her phone rang at 23:00 sharp and her eyes lit up with joy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias?&quot; Rae said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hi Rae...What the fuck have you done?&quot; Elias replied, angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What...?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;$10,000 in debt?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, oops...&quot; Rae giggled, holding back her tears. &quot;I missed you, Elias, it&#39;s nice to hear your voice again. I bought you gifts!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;How are we meant to get back?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Um...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You sometimes are so cheeky...&quot; Elias sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll call Sylvester to see what he can do...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias soon caught up with Rae at the hotel she was staying at. Elias apologised for running off without her and Rae was just glad to see Elias alive and back to normal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, let&#39;s go home,&quot; Elias said as he rang the ASID&#39;s emergency contact number. He was tired and didn&#39;t want to file this as a case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sylvester&#39;s voice squeaked over the subtle phone static as he picked up. &quot;Hello? Who&#39;s this?&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sylvester, it&#39;s me. I&#39;ve been away...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t Novem...&quot; Sylvester laughed. &quot;Welcome back to life, kid. Our systems couldn&#39;t locate or reach you for 2 weeks and some speculated you were dead. Of course, I know you don&#39;t go down with a fight. What have you been up to?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Sylvester, if you could be the protagonist in Groundhog Day while getting your memories wiped every day, would you want to be the protagonist?&quot; Elias asked. Sylvester was intrigued and leaned forward in his chair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You see Elias, this is a strange world. I would love to.&quot; Sylvester replied, laughing softly. &quot;All I can say is you might have just solved the case of the Lost Southern Drug. Congrats kid.&quot;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c5 c7" id="h.hq8ytdrxk95z"><span class="c3"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.xa6gh12ah306"><span class="c3">The Jespan&rsquo;s Star</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So Novem&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great asset. You&rsquo;ve been outperforming these amateurs&hellip;&rdquo; His expression grew, his face still turned to Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Ozim,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;These supernatural occurrences&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mastermind behind the ASID, you don&rsquo;t need to worry. I&rsquo;ve linked these cases&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton explained as he shifted towards the whiteboard. The clinical meeting room enveloped a bitter tone, biting at Elias&rsquo;s skin. The whiteboard marker popped, scribbling following, scratching Elias&rsquo;s eardrums.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jaxton sketched a quick diagram, displaying Ajespa. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No royals or anything is linked to Georgia and Rae&hellip;My research tells me Rae isn&rsquo;t human. She&rsquo;s from another world&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton sighed and placed his hand on Elias&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take care of her, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course&hellip;&rdquo; Elias stuttered, his voice suddenly shaking at this realisation. Elias had been so enchanted by her personality that he didn&rsquo;t notice the flaws of Rae. Her perfect English with no accent and her unique physique. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The whiteboard stood menacingly back against the room, the contents on the board ever so terrifying. The words &ldquo;princess&rdquo; and a rough sketch of a UFO haunted Elias, confusing and worrying him. Just who was Rae? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take this too seriously though kid, you&rsquo;ve made a name for yourself in the world, just take a look!&rdquo; Jaxton smiled, reaching for the remote that turned the small TV screen that hovered in the corner of the room. Though small, it was large enough to clearly show the headline of the news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good afternoon Indiana, this is Skie Leanne of WXIN, today bringing an international news case! Government officials across the world have correctly identified an unknown flying machine entering the airspace of Georgia, landing in Vardzia. We don&rsquo;t know who or what they are and why they are here. Stay tuned for more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see Novem, this is a case that you should look forward to. Why don&rsquo;t you put that anthropology degree of yours to use? Eh, Novem? Huh?&rdquo; said Jaxton. Elias was gone already. &ldquo;Tch, that kid&hellip;Get my jet ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias rushed into the hallway and frantically dialled Rae&rsquo;s number. The numbers felt like frozen buttons, each tap sending a terrible chilling sensation. What was this occurrence?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Such a coincidence, Jaxton mentioning Rae was extra-terrestrial and now spaceships landing in Vardzia. It was real, but Elias kept trying to deny it. He believed that the spaceship was an illusion, rather another scheme plotted by Anateros.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae! Did you hear the news?&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, I was about to call you!&rdquo; Rae&rsquo;s voice echoed. The speakers blasted slowly, reverberating. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stay there&hellip;&rdquo; Elias reassured, his voice calming down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, are you taking this job or not?&rdquo; Jaxton&rsquo;s voice lingered down the hallway, Elias finally locking eyes with Jaxton. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me get Rae first,&rdquo; Elias reassured, giving Jaxton the green light to wait for him. Elias and Rae soon met Jaxton on the pitched runway where he parked his private jet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shall we get in the air?&rdquo; Jaxton proposed, motioning for the two to enter. The interior was luxurious to say the least, with fancy cocktails and food. They flew as quickly as they could towards Vardzia, unbeknownst to them would lie the greatest case in history. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias and Rae ventured back into Vardzia, observing the large spaceship that landed in the mountains. Again, it seemed futuristic enough to resemble the now non-existent city of Ajespa, also matching the overall aesthetics they employed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Out of nowhere, a battalion of troops emerged, alienlike. Of course they weren&#39;t human, but neither were they aliens. They were robots. They looked identical to those monsters they fought back in Old Ajespa, but scaled down by a lot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The machines beeped. The static buzz tuned up into a deafening frequency, paralysing Elias. Rae stood unfazed, Elias struggling. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;JESPAN DETECTED. ANALYZING IDENTITY: HELLO PRINCESS MALVORR.&rdquo; The robots emitted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! What are you&ndash; Aaah!&rdquo; Rae squealed. The robots definitely weren&#39;t kind, swiftly dragging Rae and Elias back into the ship. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Princess?&rdquo; crewmates chirped as Rae landed on the ship, walking towards the starboard. Though she had never been on a ship like this before, it felt like she had. A mystical sense of deja vu gushed down on her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chain him up!&rdquo; the others chanted, the robots still carrying the paralysed Elias. On the east side, the robots held Elias against the wall and stripped his shirt, then chaining him onto place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The metal straps tightly held Elias in place, as if he was crucified. The metallic surface was cold, his weak body leaning forward in despair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! Stay away from the princess of Ajespa!&rdquo; a voice rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! Let him go!&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice echoed. It felt like two sides were fighting for him, one to torture him further and the other to save him. But it was Rae against the whole crew. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae, do you forget who we are?&rdquo; a new voice crackled. Elias&#39;s eyes finally opened slowly, scanning the perimeter. He saw humanoid like people, of course he knew they weren&#39;t humans as they hovered like superheroes from a fictional world. Their appearance indeed mimicked humans almost perfectly and from what Elias could hear, their personalities were robust. &ldquo;We came to Earth not to find love, we came for the Orichalcum&hellip;We came back now again&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice suddenly grew weak and her expression went pale. His majesty&#39;s ominous aura flooded the starboard, his voice deep and hypnotic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;KILL HIM.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crew beat Elias, blood spewing everywhere. It was brutal and Rae couldn&#39;t bear to watch. The beating turned into a show, with several crewmates throwing objects at him and making a mockery out of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;WAIT.&rdquo; His majesty ordered. &ldquo;STOP.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crew listened and pulled back, with Elias barely breathing. It was obvious the crew was not good at killing, with their puny attempts to damage him failing, with all his vital organs and bones still intact. All that they had done was give Elias the rotten impression that this race was corrupt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As the Jespan&rsquo;s race&#39;s ruler, I inquire what has brought you here?&rdquo; His majesty&#39;s deep magenta beard brushed against Elias&#39;s hair as he towered above him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias, trying to piece together his words, was barely able to speak. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;Rae&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae suddenly snapped into a state, even herself being unaware of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The static hum pierced Rae&#39;s mind, suddenly recalling the nothingness of a room in the spaceship. Was she hallucinating? No, it was more than just a hallucination. It was a message, a vision. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voice, it was of her real mother. Her voice whispered silently in her mind. The memories churned, her anger dissipated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This star is the last of our race! The protectors who have adorned them, and yet, you don&#39;t wish for us to survive?&rdquo; her mother echoed. The ethereal flashback she experienced felt unreal, she knew she had never been in that position where she witnessed her parents arguing. Perhaps it was before her birth? It couldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These protectors are useless, they fall out of the sky, one by one! They are worth nothing if the Avidrenes can kill them so easily!&rdquo; her father yelled. His voice hadn&#39;t changed, that stubborn, egotistical old man of a father she had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please Kareth&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No Halena, it must be done,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This world is no place for our child! That Orichalcum rich planet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You mean that planet Earth? Tch, to hell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her mind raced. She knew her real father, Kareth, was no one to believe in heroes. She assumed he had no knowledge of the Orichalcum star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She took out the pendant that she had treasured. Though hazy, she could still vividly remember this pendant came with her arrival on Earth. Perhaps it was a sign? Maybe it was the Orichalcum star?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae! Focus on this!&rdquo; His majesty threatened. &ldquo;Is that an Orichalcum star?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;yes? Can I give it to him&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae asked, not knowing what it did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Give him&hellip;the Orichalcum star?&rdquo; His majesty laughed. Rae, frustrated, shoved the small star shaped crystal deep into Elias&#39;s body, penetrating his skin and ripping apart his flesh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaargh!&rdquo; Elias screamed in pain. The star bled into his blood, a deep violet glow radiated from his skin. His vision grew hazy, and particles began to appear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m so sorry! Please, save yourself&hellip;&rdquo; Rae wept as the crew forcefully pulled her away from Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You stupid girl! Our Orichalcum star is gone now!&rdquo; His majesty roared. &ldquo;TAKE HER AWAY. AND ACTUALLY KILL THE GUY FOR REAL THIS TIME.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crew dragged Rae away and the rest focused on killing Elias. There was no hope. Punch after punch, the crew gasped for breath, growing ever so tired, hurting Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Man, I never thought killing somebody with your fist was hard&hellip;&rdquo; a crewmate mumbled. The particles appeared again. They emerged from the bodies. The flake-like shape particles slowly drifted towards Elias. He slowly breathed them in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do ya think Malvorr would say this is good enough?&rdquo; another crewmate huffed. All out of breath, Elias&#39;s breathing picked up in pace, his veins glowing brighter each second in a menacing purple. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey hey hey now! You can&#39;t call his majesty Malvorr! If you get caught we&#39;ll be executed!&rdquo; another remarked. &ldquo;Remember his Orichalcum star infused blade? The Starslayer&hellip;It destroyed our planet&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;what&#39;s happening to him?&rdquo; Another added, his attention turning back to Elias. The crew gathered around, puzzled by Elias&#39;s state. A large outburst suddenly propelled the chains that confined Elias back, followed by a humongous purple supernova-like explosion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Majority of the crew were knocked out instantly, crashing into the hard metallic walls. Shattered glass and steel shards vibrated on the ground, piercing the air that was once warm. The room was clinically cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae, who was interrogated by her real father, suddenly heard the loud, painful sounds of crewmates falling. The conversation was interrupted and King Malvorr was angry. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae. You have been blinded. I, Kareth Malvorr, your real father will show you the true world,&rdquo; King Malvorr mumbled, reaching for the Starslayer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The blade was slick, a golden handle with grey engravings of his name &ldquo;Malvorr&rdquo; glistened underneath the warm lights the haven provided. As he stepped out into the hallways, his blade scraped the ground, a painful sound complimented by the slow, purple pulsing the core of the sword emitted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae Malvorr, my dearest daughter&hellip;How have you come to like these humans?&rdquo; King Malvorr grumbled, his expression growing even angrier, his voice carrying a heavy sense of frustration. No, he didn&#39;t only feel betrayed by her daughter, he was disappointed. &ldquo;Helena, you don&#39;t know what you have started&hellip;That mission&hellip;you lied to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">King Malvorr&#39;s grim frown was permanent, his past was too traumatic. Him and Helena were never on good terms. But the mission? That was different. He had thought Helena had left Rae on Earth to command, build an army to mine Orichalcum for their race but this? To fall in love with a human? It was sickening. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kareth Malvorr I presume&hellip;?&rdquo; Elias smiled, all energetic. His energy was restored, taking on a fancy suit of armor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed, frustrated. &ldquo;Senturies! Go!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A swarm of small, dwarf-like machines flew out from a hatch, attacking Elias. His vision grew clear, more energy particles releasing from every movement of the drones. No, it wasn&#39;t that the machines were getting tired, rather it was the excess or waste energy they produced. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Elias gasped, coming to his senses. He could see his true power, his true potential, to manipulate wasted energy into something strong. &ldquo;Implode!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His voice channelled through the ship, followed by a chain of small explosions that blew up the swarms of Senturies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; King Malvorr exclaimed. &ldquo;That&#39;s it&hellip;Feel the wrath of my Starslayer!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The heavy blade clashed against Elias&#39;s sturdy forearms, able to resist and absorb all damage. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This&hellip;feels&hellip;amazing!&rdquo; Elias chuckled. A clump of particles drifted towards Elias where he formed a sword of himself. &ldquo;I have no clue how this works&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A bright, periwinkle sword manifested from energy appeared in Elias&#39;s hands, radiating ethereal like waves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This&hellip;can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed. Elias rushed in, striking Malvorr. Malvorr fought back heroically, but unable to keep up with the flurry of attacks Elias was producing. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Striking the ground with his Starslayer, the sword drew out a massive outburst of energy, sucking the energy from Elias leaving him weak and fragile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now&hellip;DIE.&rdquo; Malvorr growled, his sword pulsing faster and faster. Elias couldn&#39;t move, he was deprived of energy and moreover, his face was covered in blood. The crimson red liquid dripped slowly to the ground, each drop vibrating as the heavy steps of Malvorr drew closer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Malvorr struggled to lift the sword as it was heavy from all the energy it stored, needing him to exert extra energy into it. As he huffed and puffed ready to execute Elias, his breath slowly slipped into Elias, giving him just enough energy to create a small shard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Orichalcum Star was rotating fast in the sword&#39;s hilt, and as the sword came down, Elias smirked, rolling away and stabbing the overflowing star into oblivion. It exploded, leaving an overwhelming force that instantly broke the star and knocked both Elias and Malvorr away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Please wake up&hellip;&rdquo; Rae cried. Elias was weak, the explosion injuring him heavily. His eyes ever so slightly opened, giving Rae a sense of hope. She sighed a happy sigh of relief. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;no&hellip; This can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr shouted, as if he wasn&#39;t impacted by the explosion. &ldquo;You ruined my sword! Leave me, and for you Rae, I&#39;m disgusted. I&#39;m leaving you here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, the ship was still intact, no major damage except for the breached doors and crushed machinery. Malvorr rushed to the deck and shifted gears. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&#39;t leave us!&rdquo; Rae exclaimed, demanding for a proper answer. Malvorr, defeated, threw a furious look then chucked a sphere-like object at them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Knock yourselves out.&rdquo; said Malvorr, gritting his teeth. He slammed the button that opened the hatch, dropping both Rae and Elias back outside, in Vardzia. The ship took off quickly, soaring into space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Are you alright?&rdquo; Rae asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Elias chuckled. Rae toyed around with the sphere, appearing to be a projector of some sort. Then, a hologram appeared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dear Rae, if you&#39;re watching this, this means our race is almost extinct. The Avidrenes have conquered our planet and I was the one who left you on Earth. I wanted you to be safe, away from warfare. This also means that you have the last Orichalcum Star. They are powerful items that can unleash astronomical powers. These superpowers once created strong and reliant protectors, but now it&#39;s your choice to help save our race. Choose your hero that will protect us.&rdquo; The hologram was of Helena Malvorr, her real mother. It felt surreal seeing her mother for the first time. &ldquo;Also, you might find yourself adapting to life on Earth quite easily. Us Jespans have a few quirks, having incredible memory, being multilingual and being able to short fly. Good luck, dear.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jaxton&#39;s voice echoed from afar, calling out their names. Elias and Rae sat in peace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dear lord, what happened to you two? I saw a bunch of robots kidnapping you guys, and now you&#39;re almost dead!&rdquo; Jaxton sighed. &ldquo;Thank god we didn&#39;t lose Elias,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae sniffed, holding back her tears for what she had experienced. Were the Jespans really that bad? And what&#39;s next? Did Anateros know about their existence already? It was all a big mystery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you all okay?&rdquo; Jaxton reassured, helping Elias up back into the Jet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He will be fine&hellip;He&#39;s a hero&hellip;&rdquo; Rae whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, he&#39;s my best,&rdquo; Jaxton boasted. Rae shook her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I mean like a superhero,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kid&#39;s got superpowers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. It&#39;s a long story. I&#39;ll tell you the story later. It&#39;s what my race, the Jespans, call the Jespan Star.&rdquo;</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c5 c7" id="h.4ujwk64k58d6"><span class="c3"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.7q2br3uu5wki"><span class="c3">The Ozim Files</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias scrolled through his computer, bored. It was another weekday night, with no cases left. His door opened. Rae entered shyly, watching the dull screen Elias stared into. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Rae smiled. &ldquo;Whatchu up to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just bored&hellip;&rdquo; Elias groaned, giving Rae a grim expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Speaking of nothing to do, Jaxton gave me this USB stick when we were discussing more about the Jespans yesterday&hellip;&rdquo; Rae explained, handing him a USB with the letters OZIM engraved onto it. Elias was confused, starstruck at how Rae had gotten into a discussion with Jaxton in the first place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you expect me to do, open it?&rdquo; Elias laughed. Rae snatched the USB back and plugged it into his laptop. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His screen flashed, then his file explorer opened. There laid 4 different PDFs, each titled &ldquo;Ozim File.pdf&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wanna have a read?&rdquo; Rae asked as she pulled up a chair, sitting curiously beside Elias.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I guess so&hellip;&rdquo; And so, the case began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may be wondering who I am and why I am writing all my cases up into detailed analysis. My name is Jaxton Ozim and founder of the American Supernatural Intelligence Division in Indianapolis, Indiana. I was a veteran in the US Military, Navy and Airforce, an extremely dominant and useful asset in battle. I devoted my time after retiring 2 years ago to start up this company after we found cosmic disparities hovering about near the gulf of Argentina and Antarctica. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Topic: Cosmic Disparities</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Case ID: 001</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reporter: Dr. Alastair Davis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Entity No: 001</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Atlantic Ocean, Deception Island</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 3 April 2001</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The helicopter blades cut through the bitter air as I approached Deception Island. My pilot expertly navigated the treacherous winds, bringing us down on a relatively flat area of the island. The landing wasn&#39;t smooth, the skids crunching through what appeared to be recently fractured ice. The pattern of breakage immediately caught my attention &ndash; not consistent with natural formations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back in a few hours,&rdquo; were the last words I heard him say before I saw something that I shouldn&rsquo;t have seen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I nodded unknowingly of what was to come, watching the helicopter disappear into the gray sky. Climbing up to the peak was challenging enough, the path was blurred and the terrain was uneven. The ice had masked fragments of debris.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then, I felt the tremors. They began approximately 3 quarters of the way up, acting as a warning for me to not venture too deep. No, they weren&#39;t violent, but definitely cautionary now that I think back to it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I paused, checking my specialised equipment. The reading was unlike anything we&#39;d theorised in our initial research&mdash;not the typical signature of volcanic activity, but something more rhythmic, almost like a pulse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The crater rim finally came into view after another hour of cautious climbing. I gazed down into the volcano from the edge, inspecting the condition. And to no surprise, there was indeed something supernatural that laid eagerly in the center. It radiated such an immense aura. There, embedded in the dark volcanic rock, was a crystalline formation unlike anything I&#39;d ever encountered during my military or scientific career&mdash;a massive purple crystal, approximately 5 feet in height, pulsing with an inner light that matched the rhythm of the tremors I&#39;d been feeling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As I documented the anomaly with our specialised cameras, I felt a strange sensation&mdash;a pull, not physical but mental, drawing me toward the crystal. I tried to fight, but it pulled me into the void. Then, it was darkness. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I awoke to warmth and the sound of distant voices. My eyes fluttered open to brilliant sunshine and a sapphire sky. It was impossible for the Antarctic latitudes, but it felt so real. I stood up and followed the marble pathway that I had fallen onto, leading to an enormous golden gate. There it was, the city of white stone and gold stretched toward the horizon, surrounded by sparkling blue waters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Atlantis,&quot; my analytical mind supplied, even as I rejected the impossibility. This was clearly some form of induced psychotropic state. Yet the warm breeze felt real against my skin. The golden gates swung open as I approached, and I found myself walking through streets bustling with activity. Atlantians, perhaps. I saw people dressed in flowing garments, their actions precise. Everything felt flawless, with the magnificent gardens and intricate mechanisms all about the city. Though their gazes weren&rsquo;t bright, they held a solemn expression devoid of joy or wonder. They were disciplined.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">His voice boomed behind me, of course it was none other than the king himself, Atlas. I was shook at the moment, but his tall figure adorned in purple and gold appeared friendly and gave me a hand. His face was handsome but severe, his bearing regal and imposing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;I am Atlas, king of Atlantis. Make yourself home&quot; he announced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;This isn&#39;t real,&quot; I said firmly. I was at this point that this was in fact, the cosmic disparity Dr Alastair David had reported. A transfer to an alternate dimension. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Atlas laughed, the sound echoing unnaturally. &quot;Real? What is reality but perception, Jaxton Ozim? Come, let me show you the glory of true civilization.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">For what seemed like hours, Atlas guided me through his kingdom. He showed me temples of astronomical precision, libraries containing knowledge lost to the surface world, and technologies that defied my understanding. All the while, he boasted of the perfection of his creation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;We have eliminated disease, hunger, and conflict,&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;Perfect order, perfect harmony.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Though, I begged to differ as I observed the robotic precision the citizens had, never speaking unless spoken to, never meeting each other&#39;s eyes. When Atlas approached, they prostrated themselves in terror rather than reverence. So as the man I was, I argued for joy and freedom for the people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Atlas&#39;s face darkened. &quot;What use is joy when it leads to chaos? What value has freedom when it breeds conflict?&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a perfect world,&quot; I argued. I remembered, the history books had emphasised Atlas&rsquo;s greed and arrogance that lead to Atlantis&rsquo;s downfall. Perhaps I could escape this way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Atlas&#39;s eyes flashed with rage. He raised his trident, its points glowing with energy. He struck me, missing and hit the marble floor with a thunderous crack. Energy pulsed outward, shaking the foundations of the great hall. Another strike. I dove aside as a column crashed down where I had stood, my combat instincts taking over. All around us, the flawless city began to fracture, golden spires toppling as fissures spread through the immaculate streets. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">The perfect world of Atlantis was falling, sinking beneath the waves it had risen from. Atlas&#39;s anguished scream was the last thing I heard before darkness took me again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I gasped awake, flat on my back at the edge of the volcano&#39;s caldera. The air was bitterly cold again, the sky the familiar gray of Antarctic twilight. My watch showed that only twenty minutes had passed since I&#39;d reached the crater&#39;s edge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Shakily, I rose to my feet and looked down into the crater. The crystal was still there, but the brilliant purple glow had faded to a dull, unremarkable hue. Whatever power it had possessed&mdash;or I had experienced&mdash;was now dormant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As the helicopter appeared on the horizon, I made my decision. This would be classified as Entity #001, the first confirmed supernatural phenomenon in our organisation&#39;s catalog. The connection to Atlantis and the apparent interdimensional properties of the crystal would require further study.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reporter: Dr. Emmanuel Sies</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Entity No: 002</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Manhattan, New York</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 11 September 2001</span></p><p class="c4"><span>A tragic day. Some are already calling this the greatest terrorist attack in American history, but having witnessed what I did, I understand it to be something far more sinister. I was in Manhattan when it happened, not by coincidence, but because of Entity #002.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Two days ago, I received an urgent call from Dr. Emmanuel Sies, a psychological consultant who occasionally assisted ASID with analyzing unusual effects of cosmic radiation that might correlate with our cosmic disparity detection array. I&#39;d first met Emmanuel after my expedition to Deception Island in Antarctica, where he conducted the first tests on me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">His voice on the phone was strained, unlike the Dr Sies I knew.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&quot;Jaxton, something&#39;s wrong with my watch,&quot; he said with a worried voice. I could hear him trembling ever so slightly. &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s connected to what you found on Deception Island.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Emmanuel met me at his apartment after I rescheduled my other case, looking tired and sleep-deprived. On his coffee table lay a Rolex Submariner&mdash;an elegant timepiece I&#39;d seen him wear during our previous consultations&mdash;now glowing in a bright mint colour. Even he could not understand it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Before we knew it, we were pulled into a different dimension, but perhaps it was the most realistic dimension we had ever come across. We weren&#39;t travelling through time, though we were transported to Lower Manhattan. A strange, uneasy sensation crept down both our spines. At the time, we didn&#39;t know whether we had just skipped a portion of time due to the watch holding special properties or that this view we had was a different dimension. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">As we strolled the midtown streets, the day went on as normal. That was until we heard planes overhead. They crashed into the World Trade Center, destroying them and leaving a path of chaos. Hundreds died. Sies and I could only watch in horror. At the time, we didn&#39;t know if it was real, and if it wasn&#39;t was this really going to happen?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">I wished I trusted my instincts though because what happened next was horrifying. Instead of the day continuing, we were pulled onto the plane, back in time. We were headed straight for the towers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Like birds in a storm, there was panic and chaos. There was no control. The terrorists looked everyone dead in their eyes, guns held high with an indomitable strength that would break anyone if they got close. But they didn&#39;t see me and Dr Sies. We managed to slip past the terrorists, into the cabin. There we saw the twin towers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then the pilot looked at us, as if we stood there. He looked confident, remaining calm. &ldquo;Your country should&#39;ve done more for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Then, the mirage concluded, returning us back to Dr Sies&#39;s apartment. His watch stopped glowing. He then explained to me another incident that happened a day ago. He explained that last night, he was transported to another dimension. He entered a world where the 911 attacks never happened, a dimension where Middle-Eastern Countries thrived in abundance of technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Was this a warning? Well, we thought of it as just a dumb joke the supernatural decided to play on us. We didn&#39;t believe something as absurd as terrorists crashing into a plane would be viable for a day into the future back then. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">But that all changed on September 11th. Fate had come. The planes crashed. Thousands died. Entity 002 changed me and Dr Sies&#39;s perspectives, forcing us to either delve deeper into these cases or to close them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">This morning as of writing this report, I was notified about another possible Entity 004 that is linked to the Mona Lisa. I am closing this case as of now. Maybe I&#39;ll just get an intern to help me out on this one. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Topic: Aliens</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Case ID: 0002</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Check No. 1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reporter: Prof. Alex Hoster</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Vardzia, Georgia</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 12 May, 2003</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My last case covered cosmic disparities, and maybe this new case may be linked. There&#39;s a new city in town, where we must question the reality we live in. Do aliens really exist? Is there life out there that is influencing humanity? Just a few questions the ASID must solve. It&#39;s no easy task.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It all started that one late afternoon, when I was reading the newspaper. The headline was bizarre to say the least. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Miracle City in Georgia&rdquo; it was titled, with pictures of people crowding the futuristic advanced city. Tourism was off the charts, but the publisher was the thing that caught me. It was Professor Alexander Hoster. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Professor Alexander Hoster is a renowned archaeologist, recently completing an expedition to Vardzia, Georgia. After his last case in 1979, he discovered an extremely futuristic city now in place of the valleys. The article explained his research, unable to piece together how the city formed. He couldn&#39;t find any leads. That&#39;s when I took the initiative to call him, and little did I know, I would be dragging myself down into the largest rabbit holes I&#39;ve ever been in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Vardzia was a small city to say the least, but it thrived. Or should I call it Ajespa, that&#39;s what the locals said. Ajespa was more than a city when I arrived, the crystalline buildings with the perfect geometric linings. It felt like the Atlantis case all over again, it was too perfect to be true. But the problem was, it was true, perfect and flawless. There was no evil, tyrannical ruler, instead it was a council of the people. A democracy, perhaps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I scavenged the streets for clues, alleyways for hints. It was also excruciatingly clean, not much to work off. All that I saw seemed off of the city was the large amounts of cargo stockpiled all around, all with the same logo imprinted on it. I tried to execute an image search, but the logos didn&#39;t match anything with the registered international businesses. Perhaps it was off the grid? I&#39;d be so wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The internet didn&#39;t help either, each search leading me to a dead end. Nothing and nothing. Professor Hoster finally suggested me to meet him in Hong Kong, where he would surprise me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A few days later, I landed in Chinese soil. The last time I was in this nation was about a decade or so, stationed also in Hong Kong. Professor Hoster&#39;s surprise was pleasant, he introduced me to Dr. Lok Chuy, who had a PhD in urbanisation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Chuy suggested that supernatural forces may have aided the construction, stating that it was impossible for humankind to build such an advanced and large scale city in just a mere 19 years. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may wonder how we deduced that Ajespa began construction in 1981 and finished in 2000, but thanks to relations with people from NASA, I was able to get satellite imagery and deduce it from there. Nonetheless, we still didn&#39;t know what was happening. We were all still confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But we didn&#39;t give up. Tens, then hundreds of photos of the mystical city enchanted our vision, blurring our thoughts. We tried to piece together the puzzle, but we were always just short. But then, something changed the following day. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After one of the best food spot discoveries, Professor Chuy and I stumbled upon an alleyway that led to a small warehouse. There, we saw the same logo from before. It was the same, geometric maroon logo I saw back in Vardzia. But this time, there was text.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;ANATEROS&rdquo; was etched into a plank of wood, immediately telling me the name of the organisation that might be behind the construction. We quickly filed back to the small apartment of Professor Chuy&#39;s, starting to look into Anateros.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Firstly, the main findings of the organisation are:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_87qmd7ff8rnd-0 start"><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">The name is derived from Greek, presumably the word &lsquo;Superior&rsquo;</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">It is a private organisation</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Their leader goes under the codename &lsquo;Lance&rsquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Ajespa case is no short of something enormous. Whatever may lie behind the city, will give us more information on Anateros. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Check No. 2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reporter: Mr Neuman Borne</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Gunkanjima, Japan</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 8th October, 2003</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nothing is new. Just another possibility of extraterrestrial life. And we have evidence now. Our operations are in full swing, and the ASID is securing and tightening up. Mr. Neuman Borne, one of the newer recruits was tasked to investigate further into Anateros&#39;s plans, with some of our IT guys tracing network signals to a remote island in Japan. We sent Borne out 2 weeks ago to Gunkanjima and last week, we got good news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I followed up and caught a plane there, needing to confirm what he had found. It truly shocked the entire organisation and it changed our perspectives on Anateros drastically. Let me tell you, this entire Ajespa case has been quite crazy. I will be calling the Ajespa City investigations off for now and redirecting it to investigate further on Anateros.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Perhaps until more reports on Ajespa and the goods Anateros supplies, we will open the case back up. And next time, I need to put my best man on the case. The problem? We don&#39;t have anyone of that caliber just yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The larger image, the mystery of Ajespa is still yet unknown, too great for any of us to look into. What type of government is present there? Again, from our research, Professor Hoster claims that in ancient Georgia, monarchies ruled. Is there a king? Or perhaps a queen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My arrival to Gunkanjima Island was with haste, locating the small outpost Anateros had claimed. It was a small metal bunker that appeared innocent outside, but gazing into the small window the reinforced door had, there was a stairwell leading down. Borne and I laid low and scavenged the area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We found temporary work stations that seemed to once be there, but now moved underground. Their operation must have begun. They left behind a few pages of a notebook, most importantly, gave us vital information. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo; Borne hesitated. His voice still rang in my mind. His line was chilling, but there was no way what we read was a code. It was deciphered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were sketches of a human body with words labelled alien and Jespa. Is this a sign of extraterrestrial life? Either way, our organisation is here to end this. We will make things right. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Check No 3.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reported by Civilians</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Sacramento, California</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 1st January, 2004</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m working on New Year&#39;s day. But something horrific happened last night. Starstruck is the word I would use. I hope to never experience anything like this as I feel bad for the kid. Yesterday, after a day with some of our new interns in Sacramento, we gave lectures on the case of Ajespa, hoping to inspire any future detectives. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">One of our most eager listeners was a young, 27-year-old Stella Chi from Taiwan, wandering into the hall when we began. But the most suspicious thing happened after my speech. She personally asked me some questions, her voice was strangely unreal. She had no accent, though she was on a work visa here. It felt like I was interacting with an alien. Though, when she left, a black Honda picked her up, with a young boy sitting in the back. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be mesmerised by his void-like eyes, pure darkness. It felt like he gazed into my soul, cracking my identity to its core.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The car drove on. Then we noticed it. There was no licence plate. I didn&#39;t have a camera, so I couldn&#39;t capture it. It sped fast, fast enough that it crashed into the building next door. There was panic, chaos and fire. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was 01:00 when the fire was finally put out, the car wrecked at the foundation of the 11 storey apartment. The woman and driver? Not dead. Not alive either. They were gone. No blood, no traces, no nothing. But the boy? Untouched. Unfazed, Fast asleep. I followed the doctors that hastily carried the boy to the hospital for checkups, knowing that this might give me a lead on the aliens. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I waited patiently. The beeps still beep in my mind. I almost fell asleep but at 02:45, the reports came in. 100% human. I was baffled. How could a boy be ungrazed by such a mighty flame? Intervention? No, it couldn&#39;t be. There had to be some supernatural causes. But still, no lead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The boy didn&#39;t look a year older than 4. Such a miracle to survive. Was that woman and driver his parents? To just disappear, just like that, abandoning their child? I ran checks with our international workers for the child&#39;s identity, but nothing came up. No matches. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just another boy, left behind. I decided that once he grows old enough, he should learn about humanity. Our lives and how they are shaped by external forces. So I gave him up to a couple willing to adopt him the next morning. Still sound asleep. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their voices were calm and sweet, they whispered his name. &ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nah, that&#39;s enough for the night,&rdquo; Elias said frustrated. &ldquo;Go to bed, Rae.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He closed his laptop and pulled the USB out, handing it back to Rae.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo; Rae asked, her expression suddenly becoming worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing. It&#39;s getting late. It&#39;s almost 1AM,&rdquo; Elias replied. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Love you!&rdquo; Rae giggled, closing the door behind her. She trudged to her room, plugging the USB into her phone. She wanted to keep reading. Why did Elias just turn off his laptop? Why did he sound so angry? And most importantly, was that him? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Topic: Ancient Robots</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Case ID: 003</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Reported by: Prof. Alex Hoster</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Location: Vardzia, Georgia</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 21st February, 2007</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Big news. We proved the historians wrong. At least that&#39;s what I believe. A few months ago, Professor Hoster found entrances in Vardzia, Georgia into ancient catacombs of some sorts. A group of archaeologists and scientists joined his small expedition, finding ancient robots. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These ancient robots weren&#39;t new, historians had found them long ago. Probably a decade or so before. Though previous attempts to further analyse them proved difficult, they had believed the ancient Georgians were extremely smart until they were wiped out somehow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Hoster found was a true feat, something that transcended our beliefs of the Georgians. Their small team conducted the research in the catacombs, producing vital information. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I arrived back to Georgia last week, Hoster explained to me in great detail his findings, with the most notable being no trails of any kind. One may assume that when constructing these robots required manual labor, leaving behind footprints and fingerprints, but Hoster had conducted thorough investigation, exposing there to be none. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This grew my very suspicion of extraterrestrial life. With our encounters within the last few years, I was ready to make the hypothesis that there are indeed aliens. But I still didn&#39;t have enough evidence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I returned back to Indianapolis yesterday, I had a thought on how we could gather evidence. Our detectives have been working hard on cases, travelling internationally and conducting investigations. Who knows if Anateros is controlling this scheme? Are they trying to lie to us?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Are they trying to fool all of us, making our organisation think there&rsquo; aliens? Perhaps to waste millions of dollars funded into these operations?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Having now over 5 stations worldwide, I&#39;m working on a rebrand for the company. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our latest knowledge points leads us to believe that:</span></p><ul class="c12 lst-kix_cyaqu1cfttr7-0 start"><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">There is a high chance of extraterrestrial life</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Lance&rsquo;, the leader of Anateros may be on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list.

I was about 20 km northwest of Alice Springs, where in a dry valley, a scattered patch of swamp green roots were sprouting ever so slightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As I neared the vegetation, I began to experience neurological responses marked by dizziness, spatial disorientation, and a dreamlike state of consciousness. Within moments, my vision blurred, and a sensation of sinking overcame me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The vision I gained was nothing short, I was transported somewhere. Although the location was the same, it didn&#39;t feel like I was on Earth, rather just a figment of my imagination or a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My instincts told me this was another cosmic disparity. I was about to lose my mind. It felt like an eternity, having to survive a good couple of days in my fantasy. I could see my surroundings as they were, yet I was trapped within a repetitive mental illusion that made me question whether time itself had stalled or was in a cyclic motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My escape was purely circumstantial. A sudden and powerful gust of wind passed through the area, bringing a wave of fresh air. As the air cleared and diffused the sedative gas, the effect lifted slowly, and I regained partial motor control and awareness, enough to extract myself from the immediate vicinity. The symptoms subsided within seconds of exposure ceasing, though residual dizziness and psychological disorientation lingered for several hours afterward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I then looked at the sky. I was glad that time in the real world didn&#39;t pass extremely long, it looked like it had passed about 8 hours. During my time being sedated, I can roughly recall I was in the illusion for about 8 days, suggesting that the drug time dilation is exactly 1 day to 1 hour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After transporting myself to Darwin where I went for a checkup on any side-effects the drug gave me, I rang up a scientist I knew well, Dr. Harold Flemmings. I told him about the drug, his voice sounded worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This case is too dangerous for anyone to analyse further at this point in time. I&#39;m scared of going back, even for the smallest sample. Maybe once Project XXVII is complete, we may grab a sample. I&#39;m closing this case as of right now.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.qpv9mjjhoma4"><span class="c3">Australian Megaflora</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The PDFs ended. Rae had finally read through the files. The mysteries Jaxton had covered were all so intriguing, sparking her own curiosity now. Rae had so many questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Are there any more cosmic disparities? Is there more about Old Ajespa? Could Jespans resist the drug&#39;s effects? And most importantly, what was Project XXVII? Rae obviously was craving for more answers, but she heard Elias&#39;s door open. She turned her phone off, looking at the clock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">02:10AM it read. Elias wasn&#39;t happy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae, I&#39;m trying to sleep here&hellip;&rdquo; Elias groaned angrily as he slowly peeked through her door. His voice sounded fragile, Rae noticing the difference to his normal tone. Direct and subtly cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Rae asked, tiptoeing towards Elias. She wrapped her arms around him, giving him a warm hug. Elias&#39;s eyes calmed down, his heart beating faster. Rae tilted her head up, leaning to kiss Elias. &ldquo;C&#39;mon, I&#39;m sorry if I worried or hurt you&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae&#39;s expression was nervous, clinging onto Elias tightly as they both entered his room. Elias sighed, &ldquo;It&#39;s nothing&hellip;it&#39;s just that it got me thinking&hellip;Those files&hellip;What are they? Why didn&#39;t Jaxton tell me earlier?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae pushed Elias gently onto bed, cuddling beside him. Elias smiled and gently wrapped his arm around Rae. Rae pressed her soft skin onto Elias&#39;s cold body, snuggling tight. For a moment, the weight of everything Elias had on his mind faded, a much warmer sensation filled his body. He sighed, unable to hold his smile back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next morning, Elias woke up with Rae still sound asleep in his arms. He smiled, kissing her forehead. A slight smile formed on Rae&rsquo;s face nudging closer into Elias&rsquo;s embrace. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sunlight crept out from the curtains and gently cast on the soft bed sheets. Rae squinted, then proceeded to sit up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s something that I still don&#39;t get,&rdquo; Rae began. &ldquo;The incident where you ran into the Australian plants last time&hellip;Jaxton also experienced it&hellip;Could it be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Elias jerked upright, his expression suddenly changing. &ldquo;Where? I need to see!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias spent the morning reading through the files Rae had read &nbsp;the previous night, realising that there was something much sinister happening on the surface. Rae quietly prepared breakfast with Elias focused on reading the files. The aromatic smell of bacon drew Elias&#39;s attention, distracting him from the contents of the analysis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Smells great,&rdquo; Elias complimented, approaching the kitchen island. He sat down beside Rae.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s on TV?&rdquo; Rae asked as she reached for the remote. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Breaking News! International Reports of strange flora emerging in the Northern Territory. Botanists and scientists are attempting to neutralise this crop, but there seems to be strange effects. Back to local weather.&rdquo; The announcer explained. It was abrupt, but the two continued to finish their food then take action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jaxton is going to call any minute,&rdquo; Elias smirked, chewing on his food. Elias and Rae had a peaceful morning, enjoying some more time together. They exchanged a warm embrace and a kiss, calming the stress Elias was going through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Before they left their apartment, Elias changed into something more comfortable. He slipped on his jacket then grabbed his phone and keys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the tailor first. I&#39;ve got a guy,,&rdquo; Elias explained as he walked out the door. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They took the bus down into the heart of the city, approaching a small tailor named &ldquo;STELLAR DESIGNS&rdquo;. The interior was small but cozy with a vintage pine wood scent drifting from the register.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well if it isn&#39;t Elias!&rdquo; the man smiled from behind the counter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Lenny! This is Rae, a new friend,&rdquo; Elias introduced. Rae quietly blushed, had she always felt shy in front of strangers. It was like her second nature to not trust any human ever since her identity as a Jespan, except for Elias and the ISID. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You sure she ain&#39;t your girl-friend?&rdquo; Lenny chuckled, joking around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know you might not believe me, but I got superpowers recently&hellip;&rdquo; Elias whispered, making sure the other customers didn&#39;t hear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You WHAT? Are you implying that I&#39;m in charge of designing your supersuit?&rdquo; Lenny grinned. His expression lit up in an instant, reaching for his notepad. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lenny was the typical fashion-design student and gamer who enjoyed reading and collecting comics in his spare time. He had always been intrigued by superhero costumes and had a history of cosplaying since he was 16.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what are your powers?&rdquo; Lenny asked ecstatically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I don&#39;t want to disclose this in public, so come around when you&#39;re free. I&#39;ll fill you up on the details&hellip;&rdquo; Elias explained, writing his address on his notepad. For Lenny, it felt like a dream come true.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Rae and Elias strolled home across the quiet neighbourhood, a roaring whirr shredded the silence into pieces. A helicopter hovered over the quiet street, but Elias wasn&#39;t surprised for once. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll meet you in Darwin, Australia!&rdquo; Jaxton&#39;s voice blasted through his phone speaker. Elias listened carefully, but he was confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Meet you there?&rdquo; </span><span>Bullshit. How was Elias going to get to Australia? He shrugged it off. &ldquo;</span><span class="c9">Whatever</span><span class="c0">&rdquo; he thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&#39;mon Rae! Hold on!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed as he tightly held Rae in his arms, manifesting a pair of wings from the excess energy. The wings carried great momentum due to the extra energy left behind, creating a great outburst of wind that allowed the two to quickly travel through the skies. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their bodies touched, a warmer sensation filling Elias up. His heart thumped, the lace slowly increasing. He was beginning to lose focus as he glided through the air, the worry he was going to drop Rae. Elias quickly caught up to the helicopter, letting Rae in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, you&#39;re too heavy, aha,&rdquo; Elias blushed, trying to laugh it off. Rae threw him a frown, but couldn&#39;t help to giggle afterwards. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Novem,&rdquo; Jaxton began.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you just call me?&rdquo; Elias interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Novem. That&#39;s what I said. That&#39;ll be your code name,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Novem huh? Has a cool ring to it! And it is </span><span class="c9">my</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;last name!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, no shit kid. A new update says 12 of these megaflora plants have fully grown and they are consuming people and anything living nearby. 3 scientists including Alastair Davis and Alex Hoster have been reported dead which isn&#39;t good,&rdquo; Jaxton informed. His expression was weary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, look at this!&rdquo; Jaxton announced suddenly, turning the screen so that Elias could see. The megaflora had begun charging up a pulse or blast of some sort, with a dark purple light gushing around in their mouths. The drone shot of the area gave the crew an idea on what was happening, but not the best.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ve heard from the researchers present there that this plant is named the Eucalipse Jaws,&quot; Jaxton motioned, pointing at the drone footage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias stared at the screen, mesmerized by the murky dark green glow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m guessing these plants were originally Jespan technology,&quot; Rae said quietly, her eyes fixed on the footage. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jaxton glanced at her sharply. &quot;Go on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The vision is still hazy&hellip;Ugh. More of the visions&hellip;my memories are coming back&hellip;&quot; Rae gently pressed her fingers against her temple, looking confused. &ldquo;These plants were properly never meant to be on Earth. The environment here has mutated them. Unless someone had intentionally planted them here&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The helicopter began its descent toward a makeshift research base that had been established at a safe distance from the Eucalipse Jaws. As they landed, Elias could see dozens of personnel in hazmat suits rushing around, setting up equipment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;ISID here, we&#39;re going to take over for a while,&quot; Jaxton announced as they disembarked. &quot;The Australian government agreed to let us see what the commotion is about&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>A man in a beige suit approached Jaxton, followed by a woman in military uniform. &quot;Agent Ozim, Colin </span><span>Sturks</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Amy Victori.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great. Any updates?&rdquo; Jaxton inquired, inspecting the surroundings. Elias took flight, grabbing a bird&#39;s eye view of the situation himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;The plants are now twelve in total, arranged in a perfect circle. And they&#39;re... communicating somehow.&quot; Amy explained. &ldquo;We found some ancient scriptures buried underground that are surrounding the plants&hellip;Perhaps if we decipher it we can gain some information&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Colin held up a stone tablet with engravings on it, almost illegible. Rae thought otherwise, intrigued by the language.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stardust. Absorbs. Life. Stars. Are. Finite. Magha.&rdquo; Rae said, her voice robotic translating the carved symbols. &ldquo;Wait, where&#39;s Elias?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rae panicked for a moment. She saw and remembered something that she shouldn&#39;t have. Was this divine intervention? Or was it her mother calling out to her? All Rae had on her mind was to save Elias. She knew calamity was drawing ever near.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias! Get down! The plants are going to erupt!&rdquo; Jaxton yelled. Elias reacted to Jaxton&#39;s warning but didn&#39;t move. The plants sucked more energy from the area, knocking Elias off balance. He felt a strange sensation creeping out of his body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah! Ahhh!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed. He was flung out of the air as his powers quickly dissipated, fading into thin air. Elias fell through the air but Jaxton and Rae had caught him, negating a lot of damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright Novem?&rdquo; Jaxton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Ugh&hellip;I feel&hellip;powerless&hellip;&rdquo; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;this can&#39;t be&hellip;The life the scripture implied must be of cosmic energy&hellip;the energy that governs the galaxy&hellip;His powers&hellip;&rdquo; Rae muttered, her voice sweating in anxiety. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plants erupted. A loud roar dispersed 12 strong green beams of light that streamed up towards the sky, all continuing on a path to a different land. The plants quickly withered, soon becoming no more than a small pile of ashes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; Jaxton exclaimed. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Perhaps some people in the world inherited Elias&#39;s powers&hellip;Even if his powers are gone&hellip;Maybe there&#39;s hope from these new individuals&hellip;&rdquo; said Rae.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, Rae.&rdquo; a voice boomed. The scientists and crew all turned to the origin of the voice, the 12 piles of ashes formed by the flowers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Jaxton demanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; the voice roared. &ldquo;Don&#39;t you remember me Rae? It is me&hellip;Magha! Oh how you could forget&hellip;Your mother ruined our world&hellip;So this world will be our new home!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rae exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s right! I&#39;m your father&#39;s right hand man! The Jespan Necromancer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ash from the flowers blew along the wind, sweeping high, forming a tornado shape. The ash settled in the air, creating some sort of vessel. His body slowly formed, the ash constructing bones for his ribs then skull. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Magha smirked. &ldquo;You can&#39;t kill me! I&#39;m just a wandering soul of cosmic energy! And your best bet was just drained by me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impossible! Open fire!&rdquo; Jaxton declared. The military soldiers that had surrounded the perimeter unloaded their magazines, spraying towards the fat, old man that stood stubbornly in the middle of the territory. &ldquo;Shit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skeletons began to rise from the arid land, bones seeping through the parched, cracked rocks and sandy surface. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Skeleton Brutes! Tank the bullets and eliminate them!&rdquo; Magha yelled, creating a bone staff out of ash. He struck the ground with his staff, enchanting all his skeletons with magical power. &ldquo;Bahahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The skeletons didn&#39;t break through a single round of ammunition, rather they broke in 3 magazines. They were tough, bones rock solid and began taking down the military personnel with ease.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!&rdquo; Jaxton ordered, leaving the vicinity. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh? Well I&#39;ll be damned. Running away? Only a coward would do so!&rdquo; Magha snickered. The skeletons diverted their attention to Jaxton and the group who tried to flee. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get to the chopper!&rdquo; Jaxton yelled. He stood his ground and bought some time, barely able to reach the helicopter as it took off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where do we go? And what do we do with Elias?&rdquo; Rae questioned. Elias had fallen into a state of paralysis, body asleep and mind unconscious. Was this the true power of Magha? Perhaps it was only the weak side of him. A much sinister force stood aside him, his spirit casting an ethereal shadow to the environment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magha was one of the more tyrannical underlords of Ajespa that worked beside Malvorr. The history of Ajespa is extensive, and it is worth understanding. It was assumed that more than 2000 years ago, an alien race discovered the planet named &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; that had vast amounts of Orichalcum. Before Rae&#39;s father, Kareth, destroyed the planet, the race was rather governed by a group of men instead of the monarchy Rae knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their names? Karana, Sadana, Rukana and Behatar. The group was not to be underestimated, they had awakened the power of the stars. They were so strong that no one would dare to challenge them. Except one, an underlord. His name was Kareth and he was able to overthrow the entire system, promising a better world without the constant need to rely on Orichalcum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though this turned out to become one of the worst disasters that had struck the Jespans, wiping out most of its population. Kareth didn&#39;t kill the group, rather he imprisoned them on Earth by using the power of Orichalcum. For centuries they slept within the mountains of East Timor, waiting for the day where they would be resurrected. Only then would pure terror rise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What were the underlords to the kings? Yes, they did swear devotion and loyalty, but there was something more. The chaos and power those kings had reigned supreme as they had travelled the cosmos, finding new pieces of technology. They struck terror and fear over planets, but for Earth, it was different. It was abundant and diverse in life, something Behatar had never seen.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c5 c7" id="h.j0y400e09qbe"><span class="c3"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.7uus1hfmyhwd"><span class="c3">Tears of the Undead</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He said he feels like he lost his powers&hellip;If we don&#39;t have any supernatural talent, we&#39;ve definitely lost this fight&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton declared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The helicopter hovered over the mass of skeletons that rose from the ground, surveying the region. In the midst of the chaos, Magha stood in the centre, his control reigning supreme. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His grin was venomous almost, his gaze striking Jaxton from afar. He knew that this was far from over and needed Elias to recover fast. When they reached a hospital in Darwin, the doctors were finally able to run tests on Elias and to uncover his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s nothing Mr. Ozim, the boy&#39;s completely natural,&rdquo; the nurse explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impossible! Just a few weeks ago he was throwing a mad alien like butter!&rdquo; Jaxton argued. &ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias had already recovered, his energy back to normal. Though he still didn&#39;t feel the presence of his powers, a different presence emerged, a curious energy that shifted with chatter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&hellip;what are you?&rdquo; Elias muttered to the four mysterious creatures that hopped onto the hospital bed. Rae and Jaxton were outside, busy talking to the doctors. &ldquo;This can&#39;t be&hellip;You feel like my power&hellip;But separated!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The creatures nodded. The creatures were strange but Elias found them cute. They took the shape of strange organic shapes with a soft texture, with an addition of a cosmic-like layer of energy that coated them. To Elias, he interpreted them as cosmic creatures, companions and his lost power. He understood that these creatures were overflowing with various energies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; Rae whispered as she walked back into the room. &ldquo;What&hellip;what are those?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These? I don&#39;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh Elias, you&#39;re up!&rdquo; Jaxton smiled. &ldquo;What are you two doing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know what these are?&rdquo; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; Jaxton asked, acting confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These things!&rdquo; Elias motioned. He pointed at the creatures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These things? What are you pointing to?&rdquo; Jaxton replied angrily. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He can&#39;t see them&hellip;&rdquo; Rae concluded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; Jaxton replied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, a loud thud boomed from the hallway. It was followed by a screeching chain of screams, piercing through the doors of all the patients. Elias rushed out to see what was happening, and sure enough, the skeletons had made it here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright&hellip;I don&#39;t know how these creatures work but I&#39;ll make do!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, intuitively figuring out the mechanics of these creatures. The creatures focused their energy and began to hover around Elias like a belt, forming an energy ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh Elias&hellip;I think I remember something&hellip;This formation&hellip;It reminds me of something I&#39;ve read before&hellip;.&rdquo; Rae realised. &ldquo;I&#39;m pretty sure these are called Solarids, otherwise known as the essence of one&#39;s power. Since they are still technically your powers but separated, you should have full control over their movements!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias began as he pushed forward with both his hands. &ldquo;You&#39;re saying if I swing my arms out in a motion like this, these creatures will follow?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though only one Solarid was launched, it transformed into a larger cosmic beast, taking the form of a large mantis. It sped down the hallway and curled itself into a torpedo shape, breaking all the skeletons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed. &ldquo;That&#39;s sick!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe that&#39;s Sol-Ra, the technique to control them!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, what&#39;s the commotion here? We gotta run!&rdquo; Jaxton exclaimed, tugging Rae away from the danger. &ldquo;Elias, you&#39;re in no shape to fight!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias ignored Jaxton this one instance and focused on taking down the last two skeletons. As Elias approached closer, the skeletons grew in size and began to radiate a crimson glow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright&hellip;so you powered up too? Too bad you won&#39;t find me!&rdquo; Magha mocked. Jaxton overheard his voice and turned his attention to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Magha! You&hellip;.!&rdquo; Jaxton clenched his teeth and ran towards him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha! You can&#39;t hurt me, I&#39;m a ghost!&rdquo; Magha laughed, watching Jaxton phase through his body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can this though?&rdquo; Elias asked, sending a cosmic creature towards Magha. Magha summoned more skeletons, but Elias managed to weave the cosmic creature through the skeletons and hit him directly, sending him flying backwards. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oof! You think that&#39;s enough to beat me? You thought wrong!&rdquo; Magha boasted, quickly dissipating away. Elias quickly cleared the hallway, with the skeletons slowly evaporating from existence once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where would he have gone?&rdquo; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Timor. East Timor.&rdquo; Jaxton grumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? How do you know?&rdquo; Elias asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I never told anyone about this. I didn&#39;t even write this down. This is the most classified piece of information I&#39;ve known about and only 3 individuals know about it.&rdquo; Jaxton began. &ldquo;It was during the East Timorese Crisis in 1999. I still remember the day when we found that structure&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? A structure?&rdquo; Rae interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. And it was Jespan, now that we know that they exist. Four men, encased in stone with streaks of Orichalcum flowing downwards. Magha must be here to reawaken them. We must act quick,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was no time to lose. This was the stake of the world. Elias shivered in his body, a chilling sensation flowing throughout. He wasn&#39;t physically prepared, only mentally prepared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;insert&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Magha&hellip;&rdquo; Elias mumbled. Rae, Jaxton and Elias had quickly arrived at the location Jaxton had mentioned, finding Magha beginning the revival ritual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh? You&#39;ve arrived on time. On time for my masters to awaken!&rdquo; Magha snickered, resting his fingers on the sculpted statues of his masters that were ingrained into the stone walls of the temple. Vines had seeped through the cracks, moss overgrowing on the walls and ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a cramped location with only the one exit behind Jaxton. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Elias began shooting the cosmic creatures at Magha, weaving them through the skeletons ghe had summoned. The skeletons were fragile now that Elias understood his halved power. The skeletons fell one by one, with multiple of the creatures landing a direct hit on Magha. Magha endured the hits, attempting to tank the damage. He didn&#39;t flinch nor panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that all you can do? Magha mocked. He summoned a skeleton right before Elias, knocking him back. Elias was sent flying backwards violently into the wall, crashing with impact. &ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magha sneered, laughing like a child. As he laughed, the final cosmic creature hit him. He flicked it off, thinking nothing of it. &ldquo;The ritual is over! My mission is complete! Now to eliminate you&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You had already lost the moment the cosmic creatures touched you&hellip;&rdquo; Elias smirked through his gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Magha looked confused. Then, his stomach bloated, followed by his body turning into something of a balloon. &ldquo;What? Impossible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magha&#39;s fingers had left the statues, interrupting the ritual. He rolled around the room like a ball, growing larger by the second. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are overflowing with cosmic energy&hellip;even if you are dead, spirits carry cosmic energy&hellip;But they have special properties&hellip;&rdquo; Elias explained, wiping the blood off his face. His powers seeped back into his body, a nostalgic feeling entering his blood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This can&#39;t be&hellip;My energy levels&hellip;They&#39;re going beyond! Us spirits can only take so much! I&#39;m gonna implode! I&#39;m gonna&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Magha was cut off by a blinding white light, a burst of cosmic energy engulfing the room. His spirit faded, his presence gone. Magha was dead. Elias redirected his attention to the statues to only notice they were gone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? I thought the ritual wasn&#39;t completed?&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They were there before the explosion!&rdquo; Jaxton motioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;the cosmic energy Magha exhausted from his death was enough to complete the ritual&hellip;We just helped them&hellip;&rdquo; Rae explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh fuck&hellip;Do you know how powerful the people in the statues are?&rdquo; Elias asked, his voice shaking with fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not sure&hellip;I&#39;m just as worried as you are&hellip;&rdquo; Rae explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, they&#39;re pretty powerful, right Sadana?&rdquo; Karana chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Run! Retreat!&rdquo; Jaxton yelled, pointing towards the exit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let them live. Remember, our goal is to extract all orichalcum from this planet and to remove any that get in our way. Ready?&rdquo; their leader Bahatar commanded. They were finally woken up from their eternal slumber, the True Ajespan Kings.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><h3 class="c5 c7" id="h.4rqvj68wrqtm"><span class="c3"></span></h3><h3 class="c5" id="h.mi02zfy33ezc"><span class="c3">The Water Runs Deep in the East</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rain fell like glass beads on the window still. Drip, drop. It was another rainy night. The streets hummed a quiet trail of traffic, with cars speeding past the highway that positioned itself outside the small apartment window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was another rainy night, where Wei could not sleep. He learnt against the window, watching the raindrops fall from the glass. Drip, drop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was quiet and Wei could think clearly, something he could not do for a long time. For once, his mind was clear in the darkness of the night. A voice whispered low in his ear, his mind drifting away into the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The shadows&hellip;&rdquo; the voice hissed faintly. Wei looked around, spaced out from all his movements. His body slowly sank into the darkness, landing softly in a black abyss. It felt cool, a much crispier fragrance, a change into fresh air perhaps. It was a completely different world and Wei felt calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He let everything go and laid there in the darkness, letting the shadows engulf his body. There he finally slept, quietly as the darkness finally glowed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The morning light, like a tide, lifted Wei adrift, pulling him into the warm sunlight that beamed through the window. His eyes fluttered, waking up. He got ready for another tedious day of school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The class had an excursion to the Dujiangyan today, to learn about its history. Again, Wei was uninterested. As they peered over the observation deck, small waves crashed ashore the fish&#39;s mouth, the island that split the Minjiang river in half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, one current didn&#39;t follow the rest and a ripple formed upon the water&#39;s surface. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wei, why don&#39;t you come over? Take a look at the river!&rdquo; their teacher chirped. Wei didn&#39;t care, he shrugged and remained in the shadow, leaning against the stone wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; a voice chuckled faintly. It came from the river, and the man was soaked in water. He was naked, drawing the attention of nearby visitors. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, what the hell are you doing? You are trespassing on sacred land!&rdquo; a guard yelled. He placed his uncapped cup of steaming hot coffee aside, ready to approach the man. The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, the man&rsquo;s left arm disappeared, detaching itself from his body leaving no blood. The arm reappeared from the cup of coffee, knocking out the guard instantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited so long for this moment! Ahahaha!&rdquo; the man laughed. Wei was drawn to the man&rsquo;s presence, a mystical aura. Was he human? His arm returned to him, attaching back on like nothing had happened. Wei stepped closer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wei! Stay back!&rdquo; their teacher commanded, using her arm to motion to the students. The man began to splash the water violently, with droplets flying high and forming into small clumps. The water descended like rain, gushing down like glass shards. The man crouched, releasing small rocks into the water. The rocks followed the fast descent and began to shower the class, hitting and bruising the teacher and students.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kids! Remain calm! Wait&hellip;where&rsquo;s Wei?&rdquo; the teacher panicked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Miss, I&rsquo;m right here!&rdquo; Wei yelled, terrified. But no one could hear him. He saw the darkness capturing him again, just like last night where he was pulled into the warm embrace of the shadows. Was this a curse? The water had formed a puddle outside the shadow Wei had stood, standing menacingly. Then, the man appeared. He rose from the puddle and struck his teacher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the child?&rdquo; the man demanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who? Which child? Who are you?&rdquo; the teacher begged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? I am Kartika. Where is the Scorpion?&rdquo; Kartika yelled. The teacher remained silent. She gasped for breath as Kartika&rsquo;s grip on her neck tightened. &ldquo;Speak you miserable human!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nooo!&rdquo; Wei cried. His faint scream from the shadows seeped out, catching the attention of Kartika. Throwing the teacher aside onto the ground, Kartika bent down and inspected the eerie shadow. Wei realised, trying to remain silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re in the shadows? What an interesting power of the scorpion&hellip;But it won&rsquo;t change the fact that I, Kartika will end you! Bahahahaha!&rdquo; Kartika laughed. Kartika began thrashing the landmark, destroying the walls trying to remove all shadows. Wei ran into Kartika&rsquo;s shadow, trying to hit him. As he surfaced, he kicked Kartika, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahahaha! You think a puny kick of yours is enough to defeat me, Kartika?&rdquo; Kartika exclaimed, taunting Wei. It was clear that this was an unfair battle. An experienced, thousand year old underlord versus a young, inexperienced teenager with no idea of their own powers. Wei struggled as Kartika held him and threw him around. Luckily for Wei, he landed in the shadows where he ran and ran, away from the fight like a coward. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Breaking news: Historical Chinese Landmark Dujiangyan Irrigation System has been destroyed by an unknown person.&rdquo; the TV broadcasted. The cozy living room inside the modern suburban home in Wales stood alone on the block. It was an average afternoon, where Rayne was bored. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although it was a weekend, Rayne didn&#39;t like socialising that much. He didn&#39;t have many friends, yet any plans to even do so. All he could think of was to stay home and enjoy life, something reasonable for a 14-year-old. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He trembled as he heard the lines being spoken, a terrible shiver crawling down his spine. A school excursion turned into an attack? And a naked god-like being able to create rifts of water? He had to do something. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rayne! You forgot to do the dishes from lunch!&rdquo; his mother&rsquo;s voice boomed from the kitchen. Rayne&rsquo;s late realisation struck him like a nail, almost forgetting to do the chores. He trudged to the kitchen where he began to scrub the dishes. As he scrubbed, he felt a plate nearing the edge of the sink pressing into his body. As he slowly moved out the way, the plate tumbled down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Noo!&rdquo; Rayne cried. His eyes darted around before looking at the shattered plate, hoping his mother was not around. Surprisingly, when he looked down, the plate didn&rsquo;t break, instead it was floating inside a bubble. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rayne thought. He grabbed it, and the bubble disappeared. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rayne dear, what is wrong?&rdquo; his mother called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing! Almost dropped a dish, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Rayne smiled, looking innocent. He went back to doing the dishes, trying to ignore and forget what had happened. Was it divine intervention? Or something more supernatural perhaps? He was confused. Did he secretly gain superpowers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day rolled around, and Rayne was in history class. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to notify that students who are taking French classes will be having a week-long excursion to France while the Chinese class students will be going to Chengdu!&rdquo; the teacher announced. What? Chengdu? Rayne was taking the Chinese classes his school offered, and going to Chengdu felt strange. There was an incident just yesterday, and their class is continuing on with the trip?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, sir? Did you see the news?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah, the water irrigation accident? It&rsquo;s fine, we weren&rsquo;t too fussed about it. We&rsquo;re there to explore the cuisine and pandas more importantly,&rdquo; the teacher replied. Rayne didn&rsquo;t believe it and was skeptical on the trip, but the teacher kept insisting to him that it was going to be fine. The days passed and Rayne packed for the trip. He was still nervous that everything would go wrong. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel two bodies&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika murmured. It was a peaceful morning and Rayne&#39;s class were walking down the streets of Chengdu. They had arrived the day earlier, taking it as a break and resting up. There had been a downpour during the night as there were many puddles on the main road, along with the excess water dripping off the old and dirty infrastructure that lined the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Wei scoffed as he stepped out of the small apartment complex. He looked around, then something tugged on him. A magical force perhaps. Rayne felt it too, and he followed it like a dog on a leash, onto the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rayne! Watch out!&rdquo; his classmate yelled. A car sped down and Rayne panicked, hesitating. He flinched and closed his eyes, unable to watch anymore. But again, his bubbles saved him somehow. He didn&#39;t even issue the command, rather it was instant. It encapsulated the car perfectly, preventing it from hitting Rayne. His classmates watched in awe and his teacher was wonderstruck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rayne! Get off the road, now!&rdquo; his teacher ordered. Rayne obliged as he saw more cars approaching. However, this didn&#39;t stop Kartika from attacking. Though Rayne barely was able to leave the road, Kartika plunged out of the puddle, knocking the car that drove over it. It flipped and crashed to the ground. Rayne knew he could save those innocent lives, but it all happened too fast. His reflexes weren&#39;t enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s it! You constellations are a problem! I will be disposing of both of you&hellip;right now!&rdquo; Kartika growled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei spat out his water at the sight of Kartika. &ldquo;That guy is the enemy! He tried to kill me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That half naked guy?&rdquo; Rayne yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lsquo;Yes!&rdquo; Wei replied. His voice was filled with urgency as he stepped back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kartika lunged towards the sidewalk, demolishing anything that stood upon his path. As he crashed down, a bubble hovered beside him. His gaze shifted, then the bubble popped. It exploded, displacing Kartika slightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Kartika exclaimed. Trying his best to not praise the boy, Kartika ruthlessly spat out blood from his mouth. &ldquo;So, you&#39;re the claw they call?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Please, I don&#39;t mean no harm, I don&#39;t want to fight you!&rdquo; Rayne pleaded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you kids not realise what responsibilities you have taken? Do you think this power granted to you is just a mere gift to improve your daily lives? These abilities are the manifestations of your weaknesses, and yet, you chose not to use them?&rdquo; Kartika began. Rayne was still confused. Wei threw a disappointed expression at Rayne as he watched.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The stars had to perfectly align for you&hellip;The sun, moon and ascendant&hellip;All housing the same star&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika remarked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei listened then reflected. Was it fate that gave him these powers? He tried connecting the dots. He was in fact a Scorpio, but what did it mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You two kids have no clue what you got yourselves into, am I right? You don&#39;t even know you&#39;ve become supernatural beings!&rdquo; Kartika snarled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rayne nodded, leaving his class. His teacher couldn&#39;t care less and let Rayne follow Wei, a pair of supernatural disasters. Kartika wasn&#39;t waiting. With a maniacal laugh, he dissolved into a nearby puddle, disappearing from sight. The town was thrashed, thanks to Kartika.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;ISID reporting!&rdquo; a voice sparked. The boys turned their heads to see a young man, around his 20s on the street where the incident had happened. &ldquo;Kartika is headed to North Korea. We need to beat him. Is Elias back yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, he&#39;s powerless. Magha&#39;s the threat for now. We&#39;re unable to do anything&hellip;we must wait&hellip;&rdquo; the voice at the other end of the phone spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; the man replied, handing up. As he walked down, he noticed the two boys. &ldquo;Hey, everything is going to be fine kids! The International Supernatural Intelligence Division will control this,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A beep sounded from the man&#39;s belt. &ldquo;Hm? That&#39;s strange. My cosmic detector is ringing. There must be an issue,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The beep began beeping faster as he took it out. Darkness spewed out from Wei, radiating a menacing aura. Rayne pushed out bubbles, surrounding him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No way&hellip;Do you two have superpowers?&rdquo; the man asked. The two boys looked at each other and laughed. The man was confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So are you willing to help us save the world?&rdquo; the man asked hesitantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s in it for us?&rdquo; Rayne asked impatiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; the man smiled, opening his notepad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can work with that,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t formally introduced myself. My name is Sylvester Stylar. Have you ever been on a private jet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The boys were soon aboard one of the ISID&#39;s many private jets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll need those forms completed soon. I will notify your family about it. Don&#39;t stress, we&#39;ve got it all under control,&rdquo; said Sylvester. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Nothing disturbed Iseul&#39;s state of mind. Always adrift in a far away land, with dreams that barrelled with luscious and vibrant green sceneries. He took a deep breath. He didn&#39;t like his home. He always felt different, isolated in a country that confined itself from the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Iseul thought it was as if he was stuck in an artificial world, unable to escape the chains of a fake life that puppeted the actions of those around him. Everything seemed robotic and monotone in Pyongyang. Dreams were Iseul&#39;s escape, but lately they had become something more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Last night&#39;s dream had been the most vivid yet. Two boys his age stood in the shadow and light, calling to him across an ocean. One controlled darkness like ink, the other created by droplets of air. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That morning, as he walked to school a strange feeling disturbed his peaceful mind of his dreams. His dreams were becoming clearer by the minute. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please identify yourself,&rdquo; the command tower broadcasted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;ISID Force. International threat code 5, unknown entity is in your country,&rdquo; Sylvester replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enter with caution,&rdquo; the command tower announced. The plane descended. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, so what we know about the enemy is that their ability is to create rifts in bodies of liquid. Be careful when around bodies of liquid,&rdquo; Sylvester commented.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My power is so cool! I can shoot bubbles and stuff! What about you, Wei?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mine? I don&#39;t know much, but I can travel through shadows&hellip;&rdquo; Wei replied shyly. He still wasn&#39;t confident about his power as he didn&#39;t know how to use it well and only saw it as an ability to escape and hide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re almost here. Looking at your forms, you seem to have something called a Perfect Sign,&rdquo; Sylvester remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s a Perfect Sign?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, this might explain why you were chosen. A Perfect Sign when someone had their sun, moon and rising sign under the same sign. I&#39;m assuming you are Scorpio Wei, and for you Rayne, Cancer?&rdquo; Sylvester explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! I get it now!&rdquo; Rayne said happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Another thing, you both are water signs. Shouldn&#39;t there be a third? Pisces?&rdquo; Sylvester asked. The boys shrugged, not knowing who it was. Perhaps fate would answer that question when they disembarked the plane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Iseul watched the plane descend. Normally, he never saw any planes. And this felt different. Something compelling was coming and Iseul couldn&#39;t wait. Instead of going to school, he decided to travel down the path that led towards the police station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey kid, shouldn&#39;t you be at school?&rdquo; a nearby officer shouted. Iseul ignored him like he always did, trancing around in his daydream. &ldquo;Hey, are you listening to me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The officer approached Iseul and placed a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Why are you ignoring me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, he disappeared. No trace, no evidence, just gone. Iseul sighed. That was what started to happen to anyone that got too close to him recently. Gone. And he didn&#39;t understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t turn back nor look back, for something that loomed over him, like a guardian that protected its master. It slithered quietly and faded, a fragment of the cosmos perhaps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nice serpent!&rdquo; a voice hissed. Iseul gazed at the figure that spoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&hellip;?&rdquo; Iseul whispered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me&hellip;&rdquo; the voice whispered back, his cold breath reaching Iseul&#39;s neck. Where did the man come from? How did he suddenly teleport to him. &ldquo;My name is Kartika&hellip;I see you own that mythical serpent&hellip;It&#39;d be a shame if it were dead&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The saliva of the serpent formed a puddle on its tongue and Kartika was able to deliver a punch, knocking the serpent over. Iseul&#39;s eyes widened in shock. The serpent squirmed, phasing into the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The serpent rushed out of the pavemenf again easily striking Kartika. He flew into the sky like a pebble, causing Wei to spot him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed. &ldquo;There&#39;s our guy!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sylvester called for agents while Wei and Rayne rushed to the site. Shadows took fast pursuit upon the trailing gutter that winded down the street. The serpent loomed over, crashing into the sidewalk and hopping to its target. Amidst the chaos, Wei stood strong, running in the shadows after Kartika. He noticed the serpents, but didn&#39;t see who or what was controlling them. Was it the Pisces constellation user?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Kartika surfaced, the serpents locked onto him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahaha! You think you can beat me? Even if it&#39;s a 3 versus 1, I will still win! You are all mere children! Children!&rdquo; Kartika mocked as he splashed water towards the serpent. The serpent began its descent, attempting to crash down onto Kartika. &ldquo;You think you can hit me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kartika was ready to dive, but he realised a fatal error. Where was Wei? He was gone. The serpent had cast a humongous shadow around him. His body froze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Trying to go somewhere?&rdquo; Wei whispered. His words slithered down Kartika&#39;s spine, his body unable to move. As Wei reentered the shadows, he pulled Kartika down, paralysing him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? This cannot be&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika bellowed. The serpent crashed into Kartika, crushing his body under the sheer pressure of the serpent&#39;s massive body and the dense concrete pavement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; Iseul asked. The serpent lifted its head and a puddle of blood sat there. Kartika was gone. He had used his blood as a rift. Iseul panicked, his sweat dripping down on his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Heh, to think 3 children could beat an adult&hellip;You must be out of your mind!&rdquo; Kartika laughed, striking Iseul in the back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Iseul spat weakly. He was tossed violently away, hitting the ground hard. &ldquo;You&hellip;You&hellip;appeared on my back?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Any form of liquid! Don&#39;t underestimate the mighty Kartika! Hahahaha!&rdquo; Kartika snickered. He leapt off the serpent, onto the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just realised something&hellip;&rdquo; Wei&#39;s voice echoed. Kartika froze. He looked around, no shadows in sight except his. The sun had dragged his shadow out long and thin and a pair of deep blue eyes flickered in the midst of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;You can&#39;t&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika&#39;s voice shivered, his body tightening. He didn&#39;t know what was happening, but as he gazed at his shadow, he saw his hips being squeezed tight. It seemed to almost break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; A chain of bubbles sliced through the air, each exploding as they collided with Kartika&#39;s body. He wailed out in pain as Wei finally tore his shadow, tearing his body in half. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha! Without my legs, I still live!&rdquo; Kartika growled, crawling to the nearest body of water. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You aren&#39;t going to go anywhere!&rdquo; Rayne shouted, trapping Kartika. His bubble nicely encased Kartika, floating him into the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? No no no, what are you going to do?&rdquo; Kartika begged. He pounded at the walls of the bubble, but it didn&#39;t do much. Rayne snapped his fingers. The bubble exploded, disintegrating Kartika&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s him sorted. So, are there 9 more kids like us? One for each Zodiac?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Wei replied. Iseul shrugged. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you the Pisces constellation user?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Constellation?&rdquo; Iseul questioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s your name?&rdquo; Wei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Iseul. Iseul Baem&hellip;&rdquo; Iseul stuttered. He was nervous, but also surprised at the teamwork they had just achieved to take down Kartika. He had never felt anything like it before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He used to always rely on himself, but now he could accept others to help him. He always saw those around him as weaker than him, but now he saw something different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You wanna join us, the water trio?&rdquo; Rayne offered. &ldquo;We&#39;ll explain everything later as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Iseul replied. Sylvester reached the site only to find Kartika&#39;s legs intact with 3 other agents. They shrugged it off and congratulated the kids who aided them in the defeat of Kartika. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Once isolated and hated, now united and dreaming. Dreamers for life would always find the most creative solutions, to destroy even those of the strongest power. That was what they believed in. That was what the water constellations had as power.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.o0pce6agyzsz"><span class="c3">Your Name hurts like the Wind</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe some say was one of the scariest underlords in Jespan history. Perhaps some consider her the queen of the sky, noting that her signature move was to create air currents into people&rsquo;s throats and splatter their guts out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her reign was terrifying but Malvorr took her title, imprisoning her onto Earth, somewhere that nor air or water could enter or escape. It was a gentle afternoon at the port of Naples where a local fishing boat had discovered a hidden underwater ruin, encased by stone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The new equipment they had gotten just the day earlier had already led to a discovery they never knew before. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you been down there?&rdquo; a local asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We plan on getting some professional divers to look at it, who knows what we&#39;ll find?&rdquo; the fisherman replied. After a few days of negotiating and planning, the divers approached the ruins, breaking the stone walls. Suddenly, a strong current swept up the debris they had made, hurling them into the oxygen tanks. The divers panicked. They began to drown as the current tugged onto their legs tightly, as if it was like seaweed locking them in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was so bizarre. How could a current be so powerful? The divers met their end, dying before they could even send a signal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The early morning trees rustled in the quiet island of Yakushima. A quiet breeze entered the cozy villa the Sagashi family had resided in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms J&#39;Ning, this is our daughter. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re able to take care of her for the next month,&rdquo; Kasumi replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; a voice chirped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s Yurei&hellip;She&#39;s 14 and a very kind girl&hellip;&rdquo; Sora explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see&hellip;Well, Yurei will be in good hands,&rdquo; Ms J&#39;Ning assured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well. Yurei, me and papa must go for a work trip to Australia&hellip;We&#39;ll be back in a month,&rdquo; Kasumi hastily left as her husband, Riku, was already in the taxi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s your name?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mine? My name is Stella, and I prefer you to call me that. Calling me Ms J&#39;Ning makes me feel embarrassed, y&#39;know?&rdquo; Stella smiled. Yurei&#39;s initial impression of Stella was quite modest, appearing that she was quite mature for her age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though 22, Stella enjoyed Yurei&#39;s playful and carefree personality. She always wanted to go back to the time where one could be free and do whatever they wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To be honest, I don&#39;t need a babysitter,&rdquo; Yurei stated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s what they all say. What happens if you hurt yourself? Do you know how to cook?&rdquo; Stella argued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well&hellip;about that&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei giggled. Stella&#39;s attention didn&#39;t focus on Yurei, rather a vase that stood on the wooden case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s this vase?&rdquo; Stella asked, inspecting the magical vase with patterns engraved into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s the unbreakable vase&hellip;It&#39;s untraditionally smaller than others, but it cannot be broken for some reason. I&#39;ve knocked it over at least a dozen times,&rdquo; Yurei explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow. Odd indeed,&rdquo; Stella remarked, placing it back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the day went on, Yurei enjoyed her time with Stella. When Yurei went to bed, Stella took her parents&rsquo; room. As she entered the room, she noticed a pile of papers in the corner, stacked neatly into a pile. It read:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Riku Tsubasa: ISID Researcher</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Constellation Users</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Date: 03/04/21</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sylvester Stylar reported that 12 people have received supernatural abilities within the past two days. These people were kids, ranging ages from 14-16 with their sun, moon and rising signs to be the exact same in vedic astrology. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella sighed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The holders Sylvester identified were Pisces, Scorpio and Cancer. Paushe, another global threat has emerged. Please go to Australia and do some research to find the remaining constellation users as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&lt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella sighed again. She went to bed, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t get laid off again.The next morning, Stella found herself unable to sleep past dawn. Something felt different. The air tasted sharper, cleaner here in Yakushima than it had in Kathmandu, where the city&#39;s pollution often hung heavy in the morning air. She slipped quietly from her room, careful not to wake Yurei who was still sound asleep just down the hallway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The villa&#39;s garden offered a perfect spot for morning meditation. She settled on a stone bench beneath an ancient cedar tree and closed her eyes. She took a much needed deep breath. The morning silence was broken only by birdsong and the distant rush of a mountain stream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella, are you awake?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella&#39;s eyes snapped open, spotting Yurei watching her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you take the vase?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, no?&rdquo; Stella replied, confused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why is the vase in your room?&rdquo; Yurei questioned. Stella stood up, unable to believe her deception.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yurei, I&#39;m telling you, I didn&#39;t touch it! It&#39;s right&hellip;&rdquo; Stella stopped. She had walked to where the vase was originally and it wasn&#39;t there. She stormed back into her room. There the vase stood, in the corner menacingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo; Stella watched in fear. She approached the vase, but it felt different this time around. Instead of a hollow vase, it was filled with darkness. Stella reached in. She was suddenly sucked inside, transporting her into the vase. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello Stella J&#39;Ning. I am Aquarius. The Vase. I&#39;m unbreakable. This dimension is now yours. Anything living here will rot very quickly except you.&rdquo; a voice boomed. Stella wasn&#39;t amused. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am Aquarius, like I said. I find you worthy of this vase,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella! I&#39;m going to get you out of there!&rdquo; Yurei dived in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait no, don&#39;t!&rdquo; Stella shouted. It was too late. Yurei entered the vase. Stella swam through the darkness and grabbed Yurei tightly, attempting to leave the vase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me out, stupid vase!&rdquo; Stella demanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; the vase hissed, tipping itself over. The darkness dripped out the mouth of the vase as it laid sideways on the ground, a constant stream of nothing pouring out. Stella and Yurei came out of the vase with a thud, crashing onto the wooden floorboards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was that? Why did you come in?&rdquo; Stella yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Yurei whimpered. Stella sighed and picked up the vase again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That girl that just entered&hellip;such power! Like mine&hellip;&rdquo; the vase echoed. Stella was still dumbfounded. Yurei picked up a small stone and dropped it into the vase. It vanished instantly as the darkness ripped it apart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, give me that rock over there,&rdquo; Stella asked. Yurei reached for the rock, but somehow she didn&#39;t grab it. Instead, there was a copy of the rock in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s the hold up?&rdquo; Stella asked. Yurei grabbed the other rock and tossed it into Stella&#39;s hand. As the two identical rocks touched, a small explosion emerged, knocking Stella out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my god! I&#39;m so sorry Stella!&rdquo; Yurei cried. Stella fell to the ground with a light thud, unconscious. The lights went out, just like when she was in the vase again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella! Are you alright?&rdquo; Yurei asked as Stella awoke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&hellip;happened?&rdquo; Stella asked, her voice weak. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uhm, nothing&hellip;You just passed out suddenly,&rdquo; Yurei lied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where&hellip;am I?&rdquo; Stella asked again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My parents&rsquo; room&hellip;I was just reading the papers my dad had printed&hellip;What&rsquo;s up with this?&rdquo; Yurei asked. Her voice was serious, holding a strong tone of anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read that,&rdquo; Stella scowled, snatching the paper away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! But I&rsquo;m a Gemini&hellip;Do I have supernatural powers?&rdquo; Yurei asked angrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! Superpowers aren&rsquo;t real. You&rsquo;re delusional. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go for a walk&hellip;&rdquo; Stella replied, assuring that the papers had to be made up. But were they? Stella still questioned it as there was a clear website and phone number for the company. International Supernatural Intelligence Division. Truly bizarre. As they began their walk, Stella failed to notice the vase floating behind her, following her everywhere she went. It was able to become an intangible object, prohibiting normal people from seeing and interacting with it unless Stella had held it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They reached a quiet cliff at the end of their walk. Yurei sat down, all cheerful and happy. Stella stood behind her, unable to gain any signal to message her friend. Her responsibility was the only thing at issue here. She was tasked to look after Yurei, and it was going horrible. An incident already? What if Yurei&rsquo;s parents found out?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, an overhanging tree branch snapped, falling towards Yurei&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Stella yelled. Yurei was unable to notice it, the branch rotating to directly skewer her head. Stella leapt and tried to reach it, but she was just short. Her heart skipped a beat. She knew if anything were to happen to her, she was the one to blame. Instead of the branch hitting Yurei, it fell into a pit of nothing and silence continued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it Stella?&rdquo; Yurei asked, unharmed. Stella was confused and looked at Yurei. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t hurt?&rdquo; Stella questioned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about? Why did you bring the vase with you?&rdquo; Yurei asked. Stella looked at her hand, the vase in her grasp. What had just happened? It felt like the branch had been eaten by the void of the vase. Was it really supernatural?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did the vase save me or something?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah! A branch fell, and I saved you!&rdquo; Stella laughed, thinking she was lying, with a sense of responsibility booming through her voice.. &ldquo;It was so big!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t even hear it&hellip;So you think these magical powers are real now?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I mean&hellip;I am an Aquarius&hellip;It would make sense if I carried a vase&hellip;But why me and not any other? Why were we chosen?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dunno, don&rsquo;t care. These powers are cool!&rdquo; Yurei smiled. She hopped back on the trail, heading home. Stella grinned, a slight sense of happiness slipped through her veins. Somehow, she managed to save her salary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they got back home, Stella packed a small bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Yurei asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the store to buy some dinner. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be home soon,&rdquo; Stella assured, secretly hiding Yurei&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s papers. She took off and soon reached a public phone booth, calling the bizarre number the International Supernatural Intelligence Division had. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;ISID classified, how may we assist you?&rdquo; a voice replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, my name is Stella J&rsquo;Ning, I want to report a magical vase that is following me&hellip;&rdquo; Stella exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A magical vase? I will transfer you to the ghost and spirit anomaly line that Sylvester Stylar understands more about. Please hold on,&rdquo; the line went silent for a moment, then a serious and impatient voice waited for Stella&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is Stella J&rsquo;Ning I presume?&rdquo; Sylvester asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. How can I get rid of this stupid vase that is following me around?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The thing is, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sylvester&rsquo;s voice boomed with authority, sending a chilling sensation down Stella&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;I&#39;m presuming you&#39;re an Aquarius, am I correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, yes&hellip;?&rdquo; Stella replied. Her voice shook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;May I enquire about your date of birth, correct to the closest to the 30th minute?&rdquo; Sylvester asked sternly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella froze, but obliged, knowing that this may be the only way to rid that vase. &ldquo;February 13th, 1999, 06:30&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So you are one,&rdquo; Sylvester replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Who am I really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You were chosen because your sun, moon and rising sign all correspond to Aquarius. This is what is known as a perfect sign. The cosmic energy on Earth has been displaced to grant 12 people in the world their respective Zodiac powers&hellip;That&#39;s at least what I have concluded&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well Stella, it looks like you&#39;re on Yakushima Island. It&#39;s up to you if you want to use your power or not. I am not forcing you, but I&#39;d advise you to watch the international news. Perhaps the one you are looking after knows the answers. Afterall, Aquarians should listen to others sometimes, am I right?&rdquo; the line ended. Stella was speechless. What was this about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Stella hung up the phone with Sylvester, a heaviness settled in her chest. She stared at the vase floating beside her, its darkness swirling like a silent storm. What did he mean about Yurei possibly knowing the answers? Was the girl she was supposed to be protecting somehow involved in all this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Walking back to the villa, groceries in hand, Stella noticed the evening news playing through the window of a local electronics shop. The headline caught her attention immediately: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Unexplained Weather Phenomena Sweeps Across Mongolia.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The footage showed violent windstorms destroying villages, with witnesses claiming they could hear laughter in the gusts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Paushe,&quot; Stella whispered, remembering the name from Riku&#39;s papers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When she returned to the villa, Yurei was sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at two identical pencils.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Stella asked, setting down the groceries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yurei jumped slightly. &quot;Nothing! Just... thinking.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;About those powers you think you have?&quot; Stella placed the vase on the table, watching it carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah,&quot; The identical pencil exploded upon touching the original one. Stella wasn&#39;t surprised but happy for once. &quot;Cool, right? So what can you do with that vase?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella hesitated, then reached for the vase. &quot;It&#39;s like...the void. It eats anything that goes inside.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I knew it!&quot; Yurei pumped her fist. &quot;We&#39;re like superheroes!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No, we&#39;re not,&quot; Stella snapped, more harshly than she intended. &quot;These powers are dangerous. Your parents... they&#39;re researching people like us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yurei&#39;s expression darkened. &quot;I know. I&#39;ve seen Dad&#39;s files before. They never tell me anything, but I&#39;ve known something was strange for months. That&#39;s why they&#39;re always traveling, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella nodded slowly. &quot;I think so. And I think something bad is happening. Something connected to all this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The news,&quot; Yurei said quietly. &quot;Mongolia. That&#39;s where they went after Australia, not the other way around. I saw Dad&#39;s itinerary.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Stella felt her heart race. &quot;But that means...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;My parents might be in danger.&quot; Yurei stood up, determination hardening her features. &quot;We have to go find them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Stella said firmly. &quot;I was hired to keep you safe, not drag you into danger.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;They&#39;re my parents!&quot; Yurei shouted, creating copies of herself in her agitation. The copies flickered and disappeared as she calmed herself. &quot;Besides, if what that vase told you is true, and I have powers too, maybe we&#39;re meant to help.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella paced the room, the vase floating alongside her. &quot;This is crazy. You&#39;re fourteen!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And you&#39;re only twenty,&quot; Yurei countered. &quot;But that Sylvester guy contacted you for a reason. What if we&#39;re the only ones who can stop whatever&#39;s happening?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the TV flickered on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Unnatural tornadoes and hurricanes destroy villages in Mongolia and meteorologists predict that it is headed towards Russia,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You heard Sylvester&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei added quietly. &ldquo;If we don&#39;t do anything, my parents might get caught in the mess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella looked at Yurei. No longer just a charge to babysit, but someone caught in the same bizarre fate as herself. She thought about Sylvester&#39;s words again: &quot;Perhaps the one you are looking after knows the answers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If we do this,&quot; Stella said slowly, &quot;we follow my rules. No heroics. Got it?.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yurei&#39;s face lit up. &quot;Really? We&#39;re going to Mongolia?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m probably going to regret this,&quot; Stella muttered. &quot;But yes. Pack only what you absolutely need. We leave tomorrow. Are you scared?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;A little,&quot; Yurei admitted. &quot;But also excited. I&#39;ve always felt... different. Like I was waiting for something to happen. Did you ever feel that way?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella thought about the string of dead-end jobs, the restlessness that had plagued her for years. &quot;Yeah, I guess I did.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe this is what we were waiting for,&quot; Yurei said, her eyes bright with purpose. &quot;Maybe we&#39;re supposed to be heroes after all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two arrived at the airport the next morning, preparing to fly to Chinggis Khaan Airport.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As their plane soared toward Mongolia, the vase flew beside them, humming a hypnotic but rhythmic tune from inside. Stella watched Yurei sleeping peacefully beside her. She had promised to protect this girl, and now they were flying into the eye of the storm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rushing slopes and jagged mountains painted the roof of the world as the pinnacle of peace, with gentle winds and whispering zephyrs passing throughout the creeks and valleys. Clyde meditated outside his home, listening to the sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Something cut the silence that Clyde was used to, a projectile ripping through the fractured sky. What was it? He ignored the threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrow paused in space, halting before reaching Clyde. Something was different. An energy that Clyde had never felt before. An aura so strong had emerged, and Clyde felt the presence of it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The eyes of the sniper narrowed. But Clyde&#39;s opened. He nudged the arrow in the other direction, almost like he knew how to control this spatial ability. Was this the Buddha&#39;s work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He gave the arrow a light flick, releasing the stored energy it had. It had gained significant potential energy while paused in motion, allowing it to travel extremely fast back towards the sniper, taking him out instantly. It was quick and silent. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you working for?&rdquo; Clyde whispered, closing his eyes again. &ldquo;Why target one of the greatest monks when you already know the battle is lost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His powers were so subtle that he didn&rsquo;t mind it. In fact, he appreciated it. Did the Buddha really grant him such supernatural power to enter and manipulate the kinematics of any object? He returned to his meditation once again. Forever at bay, forever would he achieve peace and tranquility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the monastery bells rang through the valley, signaling a message. Clyde reluctantly opened his eyes, his meditation interrupted once more. A young monk approached, bowing respectfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master K&#39;lipso, an urgent message from Elder Tenzin. He carried a message about a great disturbance in the balance. He requests your presence in Mongolia immediately,&rdquo; the monk explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why the hell is Tenzin in Mongolia?&rdquo; Clyde asked, skeptical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;But he wants you&hellip;Maybe it&rsquo;s a test or something&hellip;&rdquo; the monk replied, scared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clyde nodded solemnly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine. Only because I don&rsquo;t feel something is right. I can sense an imbalance as well. I just wanted peace, but I&rsquo;ll listen to that old geezer,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed. Whatever power had granted him these abilities was also tugging him northward to Mongolia. Within hours, he had packed his meager belongings and begun the journey through the mountain passes toward the Mongolian steppes. The winds seemed to whisper warnings as he traveled, carrying with them hints of an ancient power awakening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he rode stowaway on a truck, he soon reached Mongolia. In a small town, Elder Tenzin rested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Master&hellip;How are your travels?&rdquo; Clyde bowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a pleasure to see you K&#39;lipso&hellip;&rdquo; Tenzin began. His voice croaked, filled with uncertainty. &ldquo;It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you feel a surge in energy within you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes? Did you too, master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, but I can sense imminent danger coming towards you&hellip;And I can understand why you were chosen&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chosen? What do you mean &lsquo;chosen&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe you were born under the stars of Libra, marking all three of your major houses the same sign&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My sun, moon and rising&hellip;All Libra?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed&hellip;&rdquo; Tenzin smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I was notified by an International agency requesting my knowledge&hellip;Anateros was the name I believe&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anateros? Never heard of them&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anyhow, you must go towards Russia. I can feel its body crossing,&rdquo; Tenzin finished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&#39;ll see you soon!&rdquo; Clyde bowed again, formally leaving the village and continuing on the journey.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe was close. She was nearing Russia, on the edges of Mongolia. She felt the solar underlord, Ashwine&rsquo;s presence. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My dear Ashwine, when we unite, we will be unstoppable&hellip;Your flare and flames casted into the sky by my currents, burning and incinerating everything to a mere crisp&hellip;Oh, the days!&rdquo; Paushe dreamt. She longed for another underlord after her 2000 year slumber. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella and Yurei had finally landed after a gruelling flight, where Stella was unable to get any comforting rest. Unlike Yurei who slept like a baby, Stella was exhausted. Her brain was fried, but they had to journey on and defeat the threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They paid a driver to take them to one of the more northern villages in Mongolia where it was near the Russian border. It was during the car ride that Stella finally dozed off quietly, able to somewhat energise back up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they stepped off into the village, for miles ahead all they saw were plains and mountains. It was truly a magnificent sight to see. They began to walk towards the border by foot now since it was only a short journey, approximately 5 kilometres.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they walked, a silhouette emerged from the horizon, growing closer and closer. A boy dressed in navy robes approached, with religious looking jewellery adorned on his wrists and body. The boy didn&#39;t look a day older than 16, and Stella was suspicious the moment she saw him all alone in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Stella yelled. &ldquo;Are you my enemy? Are you a threat?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clyde laughed. &ldquo;You&#39;re a superhero?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How old are you? 16?&rdquo; Stella scolded, acting tough like a fully grown adult. She knew she had authority seeing such a young boy in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What gives you the idea that you can order me around? Do you even know who I am?&rdquo; Clyde shouted. Stella wasn&#39;t having any of this. She ran towards Clyde, attempting to shut him up. All she had in her mind was that Clyde was the enemy here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a single touch of his finger, Stella froze in motion, the vase hovering over Clyde&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nice vase, stupid bitch,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed, walking away. Yurei stood there baffled, terrified to even fight Clyde. &ldquo;Hey, are you okay? That woman seems crazy,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;m fine actually. She&#39;s my babysitter apparently, thanks for shutting her up,&rdquo; Yurei thanked, grinning in laughter. Clyde chuckled alongside her, watching her frozen in motion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, I guess I can&#39;t leave her there all day,&rdquo; Clyde sighed, snapping his fingers. Stella returned to normal, tripping over face first into the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You fucking brat! I&#39;m going to kill you!&rdquo; Stella roared. Clyde closed his eyes, ignoring Stella and remained calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella! Calm down! He&#39;s not the enemy&hellip;I think he&#39;s an ally&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, it took you both long enough to figure it out. I thought Aquarius and Gemini were some of the brightest signs, y&#39;know?&rdquo; Clyde smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Yurei frowned. &ldquo;So you&#39;re a Libra?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yep, all Air Signs. Dunno how fate joined us up together though,&rdquo; Clyde remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, cause I am fate!&rdquo; a voice boomed. A sudden gust of wind swept the three up, separating them. &ldquo;The wind is fate and I will carry you to your destinies!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s Paushe for you!&rdquo; Clyde explained calmly, undisturbed by the wind power. Clyde landed miraculously on his two feet, while Yurei and Stella tumbled down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clyde began to close the distance, trying to regroup with Stella and Yurei. As he approached, Paushe took notice of Stella.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Stella motioned. Yurei barely grazed Paushe, able to duplicate and strike an explosion on Paushe, displacing her only slightly. Stella swung her vase at the centre of the explosion, trying to catch Paushe off guard. But she wasn&#39;t there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;You want to challenge me?&rdquo; Paushe exclaimed from behind, beginning to cast a large gust of wind. &ldquo;Well, let&#39;s fight, girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella and Yurei didn&#39;t even notice when Paushe had gotten there. Clyde jumped behind them, forming a sturdy formation to attack Paushe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe&#39;s arms charged and winded up, ready to release the wind. The group remained steady under the heavy currents, trying their best to stay balanced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe turned into a current, following the charge of wind she blew towards the group, speeding like fragments of shattered glass that pierced through the air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella was dumbfounded. A current? And she was targeted first? The cuts gushed deep, but not fatal on her legs, causing minor setbacks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yurei tried her ability, unable to copy Paushe&#39;s current. She understood her limitations now of only duplicating physical objects, but still, she kept trying to touch her when she came back to her physical form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clyde realised his power was useless against a current that could freely move around as air wasn&#39;t an object that travelled through space. It was everywhere, all at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The three were obviously extremely uncoordinated, unable to understand or accept each others&rsquo; powers properly. All they had in mind was their own safety. Not anybody else&#39;s, but their own.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe was untouchable. Though she could instantly kill all three of them by entering their bodies, she knew that she had to be careful of Stella&#39;s vase. It was a one way ticket to her death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Taste my wind!&rdquo; Paushe giggled. She struck first, creating another large gust of wind. She then leapt up, transforming into her current form again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But this time, the group dodged, the currents missing them. Paushe squirmed blindly, attempting to hit them but to no avail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where did you brats go?&rdquo; Paushe yelled, traversing the currents. Suddenly, the real wind swept from behind, hitting them in all directions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait! It&#39;s the wind! She&#39;s not using the wind to attack or to cut us, it&#39;s allowing her to see!&rdquo; Clyde exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Yurei yelled. &ldquo;You are actually driving me crazy! I can&#39;t concentrate!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Yurei thrashed around, causing multiple explosions around them. She was throwing a tantrum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yurei, stop! You&#39;re making a mess!&rdquo; Stella ordered, slapping her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo; Yurei snarled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait, Yurei! Keep making more explosions!&rdquo; Clyde asked, his senses coming to a realisation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh? You sure?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! Hurry up!&rdquo; Clyde&#39;s voice was tense, his actions were slow and calculated. As Yurei kept duplicating objects and exploding them around, Stella was fuming. The smoke emitted from the explosions had formed and caused a shift in the wind and Stella finally noticed. They could see the current at last.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paushe was clearly visible. She moved faster than the rest. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll kill you!&rdquo; Stella roared, sprinting towards the current with her vase. The currents were still circling the trio, and the lower currents sensed Stella&#39;s motion. Paushe knew where she would exactly be, dodging the hit. The currents grew faster and Stella missed. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The currents had begun to form a tornado with Paushe somewhere in the mix. The smoke had slowly started to fade. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We got to do this fast!&rdquo; Yurei exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&#39;t have much to work here!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clyde realised that they were cornered. But then something clicked. Paushe must be on the lower parts of the tornado in order to hit them. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella, there!&rdquo; Yurei motioned. Paushe was spotted once again. This was their only chance. Stella rushed over, her movements calculated. She pounced like a tiger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha! I read you!&rdquo; Paushe&#39;s voice whispered through the currents. Stella&#39;s eyes widened, realising she missed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you are the one being read,&rdquo; Clyde sighed, holding Stella&#39;s leg. She froze in motion, her body&#39;s position further back than what Paushe had anticipated. Paushe was travelling at such high speeds that she couldn&#39;t even react to Stella&#39;s displacement. How did she not see that Clyde was going to freeze Stella? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;WHAT? NOOOOO&hellip;MY BREATH! I CAN&#39;T!&rdquo; Paushe wailed, her voice fading into the abyss. Clyde released his grip on Stella, allowing her to move again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank me later, saved both your asses,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why&#39;d you touch me like that? You&#39;re so annoying,&rdquo; Stella scowled. &ldquo;Your name&hellip;it hurts to even speak of it,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So what? It&#39;s going to be dispersed by the wind. It won&#39;t hurt,&rdquo; Clyde reassured. The tornado faded and everything went silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We make a great team guys,&rdquo; Yurei commented, interrupting the silence. Stella and Clyde laughed synchronously, unable to hold it in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As if!&rdquo; Stella remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oi! Do you all forget why we are all here?&rdquo; Clyde exclaimed. &ldquo;Stella, aren&#39;t you the oldest in the group? How come you aren&#39;t mature for your age?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! You&#39;re one to say being the only guy in the group,&rdquo; Stella grumbled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella&hellip;I hate to say this but I see you as a big sister in some way&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Stella&rsquo;s voice softened, and something clicked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;I think you make a great babysitter&hellip;Maybe we can be a team, can&#39;t we?&rdquo; Yurei suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;d be my dream too!&rdquo; Clyde added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, who asked for your input?&rdquo; Stella scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! Clyde, join us!&rdquo; Yurei smiled. She held her hand out, and Clyde gladly accepted her invitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, fine I guess&hellip;I do have to admit, that was smart of you,&rdquo; Stella remarked. As the group walked together, they laughed happily together. A relationship was unnaturally formed. &ldquo;Let&#39;s go back home, before your parents find out,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Perhaps their journey wasn&rsquo;t just mere coincidence. Perhaps it was fate. And all along, it was the winds that carried their souls together, with it never intending to bring a painful destiny. It was meant to connect them all along.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.q29kn16rc0xk"><span class="c3">A Heart of Stone and Dirt</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quiet static echoed from the bleachers. The few spectators that came to watch the meager sport of kickboxing were few, but enough to keep Dimitri&#39;s company afloat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke Zemlya wiped blood from his split lip as he stared at the meager stack of rubles in his hand. Five hundred. Not even enough for this month&#39;s rent. The kickboxing hall was nearly empty now, just the janitor mopping up sweat and, possibly, some of Locke&#39;s blood from the mat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You fight good, Locke,&quot; his manager Dimitri said, lighting a cigarette. &quot;But not good enough. Need to be great to make money in Russia.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke shoved the bills into his pocket. Three fights in one night and this was all he had to show for it. His ribs ached where his last opponent had landed a vicious roundhouse. At twenty-eight, he was already feeling too old for this life. Too battered, too poor, with too few prospects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen, I have friends in Bratva, you can use your strength to help them. What do you say?&rdquo; Dimitri asked. Locke remained silent. He didn&#39;t want anything to do with drugs. &ldquo;Think about it, call Peter if you do,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dimitri shoved a small business card with Peter&#39;s number on it, leaving Locke to do the rest. Dimitri walked into the shadows, disappearing from the night. Then, all but was left was silence and the stoic Locke Zemlya.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this&hellip;&rdquo; Locke mumbled, his hands shivering. He dialled the number and left the stadium.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynette Florange was a perfectionist. She was the type of girl that would worry excessively. She was a lovely girl with an insatiable charm, undeniable for many men. She giggled into the microphone, her eyes locked into the digital screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you laughing Lynn?&rdquo; Jasper asked. Jasper Stenn was perhaps Lynn&#39;s best friend, perhaps even her girlfriend might say. They had been talking online for the last 3 hours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just can&#39;t believe you&#39;re actually finally coming to France,&rdquo; Lynn said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can&#39;t keep someone like you waiting forever,&rdquo; Jasper replied. Jasper had lived in Germany his whole life and was ready to move to France to live with Lynn. He believed that Lynn was the perfect girl, her personality and attitude shining bright like the stars. She had just radiated the aura Jasper had been looking for all his life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you seen the news?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo; Lynn replied curiously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, apparently there&#39;s a bunch of like superhero typa-villains that have come to Earth&hellip;I can&#39;t believe it has come to this&hellip;&rdquo; Jasper explained. Lynn was immediately caught towards what Jasper had said and began digging on the internet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ooh! I didn&#39;t know. Let me see what I can find about it!&rdquo; Lynn smiled. As she scrolled article to article, a consistent name kept appearing alongside a term that always accompanied it. The two words? ISID and Zodiacs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Speaking of Zodiacs Jasper, you&#39;re a Capricorn, right?&rdquo; Lynn asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but more! I&#39;m a special Capricorn you see? My sun, moon and rising sign are all capricorn!&rdquo; Jasper explained. &ldquo;And when researching your&#39;s, I found you are also quite fascinating!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fascinating? Haha!&rdquo; Lynn chuckled, slightly blushing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jasper began. &ldquo;Your sun, moon and rising sign are all Virgo&hellip;Such a good match as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn laughed, accidentally knocking over a vase behind her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh shit! I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; Lynn panicked, hearing the vase shatter. As she bent down to pick up the fractured shards, she cut herself. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Jasper&rsquo;s voice whispered from the speaker.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; Lynn replied, turning back to the vase. Somehow, the vase was back to normal, as if it was never broken. It stood upright on the ground, unharmed. But the cut remained. &ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just fixed the broken vase&hellip;with nothing but my hand&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn began. &ldquo;I swear it broke&hellip;You heard it shatter right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Jasper replied. Lynn walked in front of the webcam to present the vase, unbroken. Jasper was shocked. &ldquo;No way&hellip;Is that&hellip;your ability? Virgo&rsquo;s ability?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying&hellip;I&rsquo;m one of them? Should I call the ISID?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t do anything. I&rsquo;m coming to France. Stay still, I&rsquo;ll be there tomorrow at noon,&rdquo; Jasper ordered, ending the call. Jasper knew this would begin some kind of threat so he had to protect Lynn at all costs. The world was ready to erupt with chaos, again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, in Iceland, the ground shook. The ground cracked, a figure emerging. The townsfolk and local residents were terrified, the unknown entity reshaping the land.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry humans for disturbing your peace,&rdquo; Chaitra apologised. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry? You completely destroyed our town!&rdquo; a local yelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, I can help fix it.&rdquo; Chaitra explained, using his powers to restore the land. &ldquo;You see, I am a warrior of the Earth, I can control rocks that are of pureness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chaitra took the rocks beneath the Earth and remodelled the ground, shifting the landscape to be more flat, removing all large debris.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I mean&hellip;that&rsquo;s impressive&hellip;Thank you&hellip;&rdquo; locals thanked, appreciating the warrior&rsquo;s attitudes. Chaitra began to recall the events 2000 years ago, with hazy visions of 12 constellations raining justice from the cosmos. Malvorr. That impudent traitor. He created 12 strange cosmic forces that concentrated to seal the other underlords along with the kings away. But that seal was now gone. And Chaitra, one of the most respected underlords, was awake, again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Chaitra requested to travel to Europe, the locals aided his journey, paying for his plane ticket. Of course, Chaitra hated flying, the thought of travelling through the sky in a tubular vehicle made him sick. He puked at least 3 times. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is sick!&rdquo; Chaitra exclaimed as he landed in England. As he stepped out of the airport, he overheard some news about a recent, unexplained earthquake. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not by me, surely, heh.&rdquo; Chaitra spat. Of course, the only person that could shift the tectonic plates was him, and perhaps it was the plane ride that made him accidentally move them without notice. Chaitra of course ignored it, claiming it as an accident for such a terrible experience. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me young man,&rdquo; a stranger asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Young man? Me? Oh my!&rdquo; Chaitra laughed, blushing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, you! Do you know the way to this warehouse?&rdquo; the stranger asked again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m a tourist,&rdquo; Chaitra replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have a phone? Mine is dead.&rdquo; the stranger replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a phun&hellip;phone?&rdquo; Chaitra asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dammit, your looks are really a deception&hellip;you&rsquo;re older than you look old geezer&hellip;&rdquo; the stranger remarked, walking off frustrated. What was a phone? Chaitra was still confused. What had humans achieved in just a mere 2000 years? Whatever it was, Chaitra pushed it aside and considered it insignificant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The stranger moved to an alleyway, outside Chaitra&rsquo;s vision. But an unsettling aura emerged from the stranger. Chaitra could feel such a strong, indomitable force from him, his muscular structure screaming &ldquo;I am a warrior&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Locke Zemlya&hellip;&rdquo; a voice whispered. Chaitra decided to overhear the two. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for forgetting to provide you with information. The location of the warehouse is in Limoges, France.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll head over.&rdquo; Locke grunted, handing the man a bag of goods. A handful of green slips were exchanged and Chaitra was curious. Chaitra barged into a random shop, with a large glistening sign displaying the word &ldquo;GUCCI&rdquo; and walked up to a salesperson.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want a handful of thin green strips or what not, with a bag of white stuff!&rdquo; Chaitra demanded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to leave. We cannot tolerate behaviour like that,&rdquo; the salesperson asked. Chaitra looked confused but obliged, leaving the store in frustration. Chaitra wandered the streets in his unique attire, catching the eyes of local residents. People thought lowly of him, believing his oversized robe and fibre strips were something otherworldly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was predetermined that Chaitra would return to the airport once last time, strongly remarking that this was his final time to ever ride an airplane. He wanted to get to France. It wasn&rsquo;t just to explore, but an opportunity to challenge that man with the mystical aura. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke soon arrived in France. It was a nice change of scenery for him, the weather now finally warm and peaceful. He had never felt such calmness in a city where millions called home. The gentle breeze swept against his rigid body, towering like an indomitable wall. Locke was determined to finish the job. He needed this money. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Outside the airport, the air was clean. Another silhouette stepped into view. This time, Jasper had arrived. He perceived Paris as a place where people ate the finest of foods, a place where French cuisine was at its pinnacle. He had always wanted to try the exquisite foods, especially with Lynn. It felt realistic for a first date and he was going to go through it. Then, a familiar voice rang in his ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jasper!&rdquo; Lynn shouted. Jasper&rsquo;s face lit up as he saw Lynn, rushing over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Watch it man!&rdquo; Locke exclaimed as Jasper almost ran into him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jasper replied, navigating his way to Lynn. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say, do you know how to get to this place?&rdquo; Locke asked, turning to Jasper and Lynn. Jasper and Lynn, initially skeptical of helping, decided to help Locke anyway despite him asking nicely. It was second nature to just help those who needed it and Lynn knew where the location was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke soon departed, greatly thanking Lynn for her help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Locke, if you need help, just call me!&rdquo; Lynn offered, writing her number on a piece of paper. Jasper didn&rsquo;t think much of this interaction, knowing that Lynn was just a kindhearted girl who would go out of her troubles to help others. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you lots, I greatly appreciate it,&rdquo; Locke replied, waving goodbye. He got into a rented vehicle and drove off. The warehouse became larger as Locke approached, its metallic exterior extruding out from the landscape of Saint-Gervais. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alan&hellip;It&rsquo;s me, Locke,&rdquo; Locke shouted. His voice reverberated through the warehouse, but all that replied to him was his echo, then silence. No one was there. Locke marched forward carefully, with each step being fragile and with purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Freeze! We were informed about a drug trade here. Put your hands where I can see them!&rdquo; Police officers had surrounded Locke from behind. Locke slowly turned, trying to reason. The officers thought differently and interpreted his sign of turning as a method of attack, instantly shooting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke&rsquo;s instincts forced him into his only defence pose, the x pose. Miraculously, he wasn&rsquo;t injured, rather the police fell like dominoes with bullet holes in their bodies, blood spewing out with flesh gushing out. The scene was grotesque, so Locke fled, knowing that the deal he was promised was all a setup. No one cared about him. No one had any respect for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper and Lynn had a romantic date, spending time at a fancy restaurant and eating fresh seafood. Caviar, with other exotic foods was a first for Jasper and he savoured every moment and cherished every bite he took. It was a new experience. As dessert came around, Lynn received a call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold on, let me take this call real quick. I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; Lynn replied. &ldquo;Hello? Lynette Florange speaking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Lynn, it&rsquo;s me Locke. Uhm, I know this is a terrible time but do you know where a good hotel is?&rdquo; Locke asked. While the two continued their call, a mysterious presence trudged along the road where Lynn and Jasper were dining.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was none other than Chaitra, drawn towards Jasper and Lynn&rsquo;s mysterious auras. Were there more of these magical humans? Chaitra had to challenge them. He hadn&rsquo;t had a fight in ages. But first, he needed to feast. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? This menu is exorbitant!&rdquo; Chaitra exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, what are you going to order?&rdquo; the waitress asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo; Chaitra demanded. &ldquo;Give me some bread!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The waitress brought a bowl of bread to Chaitra where he feasted quietly while the other customers watched in irk. Lynn couldn&rsquo;t help but notice Chaitra&rsquo;s unusual habits, unable to take her eye off him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What a poor guy&hellip;can only afford some bread&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ignore him. You&rsquo;re going over,&rdquo; Jasper whispered, trying not to draw attention. But Lynn didn&rsquo;t listen. Suddenly, Chaitra stood up and snapped the table apart, throwing the tabletop away. A waitress rushed over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, what is the matter?&rdquo; the waitress asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is the matter? Are you trying to kill me? There was a bug in the food! It reminds me of scum and mold, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in 2000 years!&rdquo; Chaitra yelled. Lynn being the perfectionist she always was, touched the table, allowing it to restore to its original form. The table was fixed and Chaitra watched in disbelief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright young lady, I have to say. Wanna spar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here? Hell no!&rdquo; Lynn exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then the park?&rdquo; Chaitra offered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine. But you&#39;re easy!&rdquo; Lynn smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they transferred to the nearby park, Chaitra began first. At first, Lynn saw Chaitra as an easy target. She was immediately rendered wrong. Jasper watched in terror as Chaitra pulled out two massive boulders from the earth, aimed directly towards Lynn. She stood no chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Surrender now or I will proceed to kill you. Do you wish to continue like a noble warrior, believing that death in battle is the only way forward?&rdquo; Chaitra announced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn stepped back in terror, away from the two humongous rocks that were ready to squish her. She couldn&#39;t be the valiant hero, she was nothing but a mere coward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper entered next, not evening knowing his own power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this terribly strong presence I sense?&rdquo; Chaitra questioned. Jasper was confused and gazed at Chaitra.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Chaitra felt darkness surrounding him, unable to move. As his senses returned, he found himself in a black dimension, with glistening white barriers in strange formations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is this illusion?&rdquo; Where is the truth?&rdquo; Chaitra demanded. He tried to use his powers, but nothing worked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess you&#39;re in my playground&hellip;This is my domain!&rdquo; Jasper yelled, guessing his own abilities. He had seen similar abilities like this in his favourite game, league of legends where champions could trap and duel enemies in an alternate space.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper could feel Chaitra&#39;s power being strained from him, now seeping into himself as strength. No, it didn&#39;t grant him his abilities, rather just enhanced strength based on his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This feels&hellip;amazing!&rdquo; Jasper pounced towards Chaitra, landing an elbow then a kick. Chaitra smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nice moves. I respect that,&rdquo; Chaitra remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? You tryna win via flattery?&rdquo; Jasper scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fight like a warrior! No time to talk!&rdquo; Chaitra shouted, knocking Jasper back with a kick. Chaitra followed, his physical strength still empowering Jasper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper froze. Though Chaitra was imprisoned for 2000 years, he was still far more experienced in combat than Jasper had. Jasper stood little to no chance. Another devastating uppercut followed, instantly rendering Jasper unconscious. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The illusion, or in Jasper&#39;s words his domain, was gone. The park was unharmed and the cool evening breeze swept through Chaitra&#39;s short, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You two obviously have potential, so I&#39;ll give you an offer. Your boyfriend ain&#39;t dead, just passed out,&rdquo; Chaitra offered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you won&#39;t kill us?&rdquo; Lynn stuttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course not! What fun is it if a human battles an ant? Of course the fun in fighting is when you have great competition! Only then I can defeat you both with honour!&rdquo; Chaitra explained. &ldquo;So, I&#39;ll give you all exactly 1 year to grow stronger. Then you can challenge me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chaitra plucked his earrings out, then with a quick push against Lynn and Jasper&#39;s necks, the rings attached onto both their aortas. &ldquo;These rings will dissolve in your body and are made from the minerals found in the Earth. It is capable of turning you into stone. The antidotes are on my fingers, which you will get from defeating me in one year. I wish you luck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, Chaitra disappeared. He sank into the Earth, the rocks carrying him away. Then, a stressed Locke emerged from the darkness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lynn, I felt your presence and an overwhelming energy force&hellip;What happened?&rdquo; Locke panicked. He saw Jasper passed out on the soft and damp grass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&hellip;the&hellip;rock guy&hellip;he&#39;s powerful&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn&#39;s voice was weak and she was stuttering as if she had seen a ghost. Just the thought of Chaitra haunted her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke sighed, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;I&#39;ll avenge both of you. Myself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, please! Locke, you don&#39;t know what you are getting yourself into!&rdquo; Lynn cried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I may be walking in blind, but that doesn&#39;t cover my resolve. I&#39;ll do something till I die.&rdquo; Locke smiled, walking quietly away into the night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke followed the thick, heavy energy trail Chaitra had emitted, following him to the Loire Plains. It was such a bizarre spot, but the energy dispersed there and Locke believed it was where Chaitra was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; Chaitra began. He stood quietly behind Locke&#39;s car, leaning on the trunk. &ldquo;Your energy&hellip;It feels familiar&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You must be Chaitra&hellip;&rdquo; Locke grumbled, slamming the car door shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&#39;t answer questions with questions&hellip;&rdquo; Chaitra smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Locke Zemlya. I&#39;m here to avenge my friends.&rdquo; Locke stated, his voice firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do warn you, I won&#39;t go easy on you. Despite the fact that I held back with your friends, I did promise that I&#39;d only rematch with them, not you. I will kill you.&rdquo; Chaitra explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m the toughest competition you will ever have&hellip;&rdquo; Locke mumbled. His voice was tense, his tone serious and gritted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh? Then let&#39;s have a battle to show it! Let&#39;s begin!&rdquo; Chaitra announced, beginning to attack. He crushed two rocks together, trying to flatten Locke like a pancake but he dodged. Locke sneered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is with your confidence? I&#39;ve never seen anything like this! Most challengers fear me. I do have to respect you for that&hellip;&rdquo; Chaitra remarked. Locke chuckled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Earth slam!&rdquo; Chaitra yelled. Locke kept his distance, knowing that he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance at close range, despite himself as a prodigy kickboxer. He stepped back, unbeknownst to him it was a trap. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A meteor had begun falling from the sky. Chaitra had planned this, knowing the meteor belt was just nearing these plains. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just what was this guy&rsquo;s range? Locke thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke watched the meteor fall, unable to think properly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see, meteors are pure rock and I have full control over them. I&rsquo;m sorry Locke, but you were truly a great fighter. I almost thought I&rsquo;d lost that to be honest,&rdquo; Chaitra commended.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The meteor pierced through the atmosphere, creating a devastating trail of fire. It began speeding faster and faster, directly aimed towards Locke. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done!&rdquo; Locke yelled as he leapt towards the meteor. He had remembered. He also possessed an ability. He just didn&rsquo;t realise it. He remembered when he was shot by the police before. He had reflected the bullet. It was indeed his favourite x-guard pose. It had something special about it. No, it wasn&rsquo;t any flashy ability anyone had, but one of the most useful abilities he could wish for.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the meteor struck Locke, Chaitra took a deep breath. He clapped, even a tear falling from his eye. He was truly pleased and astonished by Locke&rsquo;s sense of sportsmanship and his fighting skills, identifying him as a &ldquo;true&rdquo; man. But it wasn&rsquo;t over. The meteor seemed to draw closer to him. Indeed it did hit Locke, but it had changed directory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Chaitra realised. &ldquo;How did you&hellip;You jumped towards it on purpose, to change its trajectory?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! And it&rsquo;s more powerful I believe&hellip;Thanks to you now you are assured dead. I do have to commend you for being such a worthy opponent. I&rsquo;ve never had a fight like this before. You&rsquo;ve pushed me to my absolute limits. I thank you for that!&rdquo; Locke smiled. The rock was now touched and rendered impure, and Chaitra had no way of controlling it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chaitra stood there, jaw unhinged and wide open. He was wonderstruck. He had never seen anything this glorious before and Locke had embodied what it truly was to be a man. To never give up. Locke&#39;s ability didn&#39;t even fully counter him; if he had calculated and coordinated his attacks better, his victory was assured. But he never knew his ability. Neither did Locke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He realised his fatal error in his own battle, accepting his own defeat. He had no honour left. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry my dear underlords. My time has come. At least I will die in honour&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His arms flailed, kneeling and accepting his fate. Perhaps he wanted someone as strong as Locke to beat him. The meteor struck, absolutely destroying Chaitra. It almost instantly incinerated his body, leaving no trace of life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is for Lynnette and Jasper&hellip;Though you promised to fight them once they grew stronger, I guess you&rsquo;ll never live to fulfil that promise,&rdquo; Locke grunted towards the pile of ashes. He picked up the special antidotes that weren&#39;t incinerated by the meteor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been done. Locke had beaten Chaitra all by himself. Once crowned as the king of planets, Chaitra was easily defeated by Locke himself. Chaitra&#39;s warrior attitude was something Locke looked up to. Someone as courageous and kind as that, how could they die so easily to a mere human with no experience in fighting, yet his own ability? Perhaps it had nothing to do with honour. Perhaps it depended on love and passion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>As Locke returned to France to find Lynn and Jasper, he felt proud of what he had done. Perhaps it was true that someday he would find his true purpose. A purpose so strong that it could reshape the earth, down to the tiniest of details. It&rsquo;s what the planet needed. Grounded, strong and realistic people who had strong motives and clear goals. Nothing of a fantasy, but something more direct and impactful. That is what the earth constellations had believed.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.8038n1fzzxal"><span class="c3">A Gamble of Flame and Flare</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ice in the far northern reaches of the world began to crack. It didn&#39;t surface much, it rather bathed under the thick ice, entrapped in a solid frozen prison. A scream echoed, slowly aiding the tearing of the ice. He was awakening from the ice. Ashwine was reborn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That stupid traitor&hellip;my flames are all white now!&rdquo; Ashwine erupted, his flaming body now instead of fire, was constructed of ice-like shards that danced with his movements, mimicking that of flames. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine was once considered one of the most lethal underlords, reaching temperatures the same as the sun. His touch was immaculate, able to burn anything to a crisp. The solar energy he had was eternal, but now it was a dense ball of ice. Flaming ice, to be exact.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His flames didn&#39;t feel much different, rather it felt more mystical. It was more crisp and his powers felt stronger. He dipped his body into the waters. Instead of being put out, his icy exterior froze the sea he stood on solid, allowing him to walk on water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine chuckled, grinning at his power. It was upgraded from a certain degree, mostly that his flames were now white. Of course, being the underlord he was, he wanted to find his friends. He felt the presence of one calling to him from the core of the Earth, so he began flying towards the voice that sought for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He first soared the skies and landed in the murky town of J&otilde;hvi, Estonia. It was a small and isolated town, but Ashwine found it quite cozy. However, it wasn&rsquo;t welcoming when he saw a couple walking home, holding hands. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Love&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine mumbled. &ldquo;How do humans need to rely on one another so much&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, like the barbarian he was, he ruthlessly took their lives. He couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch anyone be together. But where would he go? He wanted some place quiet and dark, a place where he could think and grow stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Egypt? Perhaps. The Pyramids were definitely a point of interest. He assumed that in a barren wasteland of sand and gold, maybe it was the perfect place to revitalise. But as he travelled, he overheard stories of war and conflict. He was interested, so he decided to see for himself what this fighting was all about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; men cried. Gunfire littered the streets of Yemen, with UAE forces hidden on the high ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pathetic humans. Perhaps a god is needed to settle this dispute&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine scoffed. He glided down with his now Golden Flames, gently landing in the midst of bullets. His flames engulfed the firestorm of ammunition, eating each pellet like peas. &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine swiftly murdered the mass, incinerating all bodies in the vicinity. Not even a single trace. Even the snipers in the highest grounds were killed in an instant, their bodies reduced to nothing but a clump of ash. His flames flickered now golden, for the sand imbuing into his fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My child&hellip;&rdquo; one whimpered, almost surviving. Ashwine heard the distant voice, quickly finishing him off without further notice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is boring&hellip;Perhaps I will take a nap in Tutankhamun&rsquo;s coffin&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine sighed, flying to Egypt without a cause. And there he laid, asleep again for another decade after his imprisonment to grow stronger. His flames raged louder and faster the more blood he sought, claiming every soul as a source of fuel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun hung high, casted a warm, ethereal glow onto the narrow, dust-worn streets of Arada. The air hung heavy, like a grudge on the window of Samir Najm&#39;s home. No, it wasn&#39;t guilt nor regret, but something he held dear. Everyone dismissed him for clinging to his father&#39;s death for so long. It had already been a decade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir&#39;s father once was a sniper whose life was claimed by the relentless war, existing now only in faded photographs and whispered stories shared by his mother and elderly neighbours. He felt the dust ridden frames, and couldn&#39;t bear to let go of him in mind. He wanted to follow him to respect his legacy and honour.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, this meant archery had become one of Samir&#39;s greatest hobbies, practising almost every day. Each time he drew his bow, the world would fall silent. His breath was measured, his aim was calculated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When he drew his bow today, it snapped. The worn wooden frame had broken and Samir&#39;s motivations were crushed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma!&rdquo; Samir exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, Samir?&rdquo; his mother replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The bow&hellip;&rdquo; Samit stuttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;My bow&hellip;It broke&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no&hellip;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get over it&hellip;&rdquo; his mother comforted, gently holding his hand. &ldquo;My baby, I told you&hellip;Your father had risked his life for the country&hellip;I don&#39;t want my son to die the same way&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir&#39;s expression widened, then sighed. &ldquo;Ma, this is the closest thing I can do to feel one with papa,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I said you can&#39;t keep doing this&hellip;Do you really think your father would want this?&rdquo; his mother snapped. Samir&rsquo;s fists grew with rage, but he clenched his hatred tight, dispelling it throughout his body. Of course, being the kid he was, knew nothing about wars. He didn&rsquo;t even know how his father had died. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Samir trudged along the sidewalks, all he could think about was how he could fix his bow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come get your readings! Come get your readings! Cheap Tarot or Zodiac readings!&rdquo; a fortune teller announced. The small stall on the entrance of an alleyway stood distinguished, completely unnatural to the stark, grey buildings that sandwiched it. &ldquo;Hey kid, you want a free reading?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir gave the man a discerned look. He was skeptical of his legitimacy, but still sat down at the table covered in a purple cloth. In the end, it was free either way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I sense a great cosmic energy about you!&quot; the teller exclaimed, waving his bejeweled hands dramatically over a deck of worn cards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah?&quot; Samir raised an eyebrow skeptically, crossing his arms over his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;So, when&#39;s your birthday?&quot; the teller asked, shuffling the cards with surprising dexterity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;December 15th,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Time and place?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;07:00, here,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Arada&hellip;Alright&hellip;That gives me a very unique insight&hellip;&quot; the teller muttered, spreading the cards in an arc across the purple cloth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What is your conclusion?&quot; Samir leaned forward, despite himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sagittarius rules your sun, moon and rising. Your heart is full of flame, rage and desire. You are destined for success&hellip;Luck is on your side&hellip;That is what I see&hellip;&quot; the teller proclaimed with absolute certainty, tapping a finger on a card depicting a figure with a bow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Success? Lucky my ass! First, my bow broke this morning. What are you talking about?&quot; Samir shouted, slamming on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t deny my claims. You will see. The fire will erupt from your heart and let that fire guide your way,&quot; the teller smiled mysteriously, gathering his cards with practiced calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir walked away in anger. What was that all about? That liar of a fortune teller had deceived him. Or had he? Samir wandered with his head buried in the sand, completely missing the fact that something had happened. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know, your father was an excellent sniper!&rdquo; the teller yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir snapped back, marching towards him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare mention my father!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can tell you all about him&hellip;I can sense that you&rsquo;re curious about war&hellip;and perhaps how your father disappeared&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir reluctantly sat down back on the stool, his hands still trembling with anger. He exhaled sharply, trying to compose himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Your father&#39;s spirit is so strong&hellip;I can feel it now&hellip;&quot; the teller stated, motioning with his hands. Samir&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;He had an indomitable spirit, terrific precision and a perfect mind&hellip;You&#39;re not anything like your old man&hellip;but your own spirit is fiery&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And? How did my father die?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;He isn&#39;t dead.&quot; the teller whispered, his eyes suddenly becoming unfocused as if seeing something beyond the cramped stall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What? Nonsense!&quot; Samir scoffed, but his voice betrayed a hint of desperate hope beneath the disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, he&#39;s in a hybrid state. He never fulfilled his goal, so his spirit or soul, some might say remains on Earth&hellip;He died when he was trying to assassinate someone&hellip;someone must have found his spot and brutally gutted him&hellip;&quot; the teller began. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir interrupted him halfway, lunging at him with rage in his voice. He yanked him by the collar. &quot;You don&#39;t know anything about my father! Shut up!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teller felt a cold and sharp object pressing against his neck from behind. Sweat dripped from his forehead, and his body shivered in terror. Samir coldly pushed the teller back, then left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir walked away and didn&#39;t turn back this time. He muffled the voices and noises that came around, ignoring the presence of the golden tipped arrow following him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; Samuel exclaimed, throwing his school bag on the ground and slumping onto a seat. His dad was still in his police uniform, and grumbled from the kitchen. He stepped out with a warm mug of coffee in his hand, still looking tired from the night before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey son,&rdquo; his father greeted. &ldquo;How was school?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great. I got an A+ on my Law test!&rdquo; Samuel smiled, turning on the TV. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Today in the world: Supernatural incidents have been happening across the globe and we&rsquo;ve seen unusual heroes save many casualties. Rumors have that there is another supernatural threat still unattended to, but still unidentified. Any reports to the ISID would be greatly beneficial,&rdquo; the broadcaster announced, beside displaying a figure embodied in white flames. Though only a rough sketch, Samuel was intrigued.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When his father saw the static image, his arm froze and dropped his coffee. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad! Are you alright?&rdquo; Samuel exclaimed, immediately tending to his aid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m alright&hellip;Just that image reminds me&hellip;&rdquo; his father remarked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reminds you of&hellip;?&rdquo; Samuel began, gathering pieces of the shattered mug.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That night&hellip;when I told you your parents disappeared&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is this about my real parents?&rdquo; Samuel asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;To be honest&hellip;I never really had the courage to tell you&hellip;I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t accept this truth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it? Tell me, dad!&rdquo; Samuel begged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Well, I believe that fiery figure </span><span class="c9">killed </span><span class="c0">your parents. Your parents never disappeared, but he incinerated them into nothing. Can you believe that? I was on patrol and saw everything unfold, but was too afraid to intervene&hellip;&rdquo; his father explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samuel sat motionless, the broken ceramic fragments still clutched in his hand. The sharp edges dug into his palm, but he barely noticed the pain. &quot;You... saw it happen? All this time you knew?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer Magi&#39;s weathered face creased with regret. &quot;I couldn&#39;t explain it, Samuel. Who would believe me? A man made of fire? They would have taken you away from me, put you in the system. I couldn&#39;t let that happen. Your name isn&rsquo;t Samuel Magi, rather Samuel Paike. Perhaps you were too young to remember&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;But all these years...&quot; Samuel&#39;s voice trailed off as his eyes returned to the television screen. The image of white flames seemed to flicker despite being a still photograph. Something stirred in the depths of his memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His mother had always told him about the importance of having rules. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rules keep us safe, Samuel. Remember the rules.&rdquo; Those words rang in Samuel&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Leo, you&rsquo;re the Lion that leads the pack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, Samuel, like the responsible boy he was, kept quiet about this topic, knowing that his foster father was sensitive towards this information. He kept it a secret, and began researching more about this flame entity. He scoured news archives, paranormal forums, even his father&#39;s confidential police reports when he wasn&#39;t looking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sam, what are you doing?&quot; Officer Magi asked one evening, entering his bedroom. &quot;What are you doing looking through these old files of mine?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&rsquo;m worried,&quot; Samuel said worriedly. The words hung in the air between them, soft but bitter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about it, I already told you. Please, let go of this topic,&quot; he said sternly, closing Samuel&rsquo;s laptop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samuel instinctively prevented his father from closing his laptop and suddenly snapped. &quot;No! You will tell me everything you know about that night!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His words were delivered cold and strong, it sounded like nothing but of a strong conviction Samuel had developed over the past two days. It had completely reconstructed the atmosphere of the room, instead of the warm and cozy vibe, Officer Magi felt a mystical sense of truth and bitterness. No deception, no illusions, but only the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It was March 3rd, 2013. I was relatively close friends with your parents, since I lived next door. It was around 19:00 PM when I was leaving my home to purchase dinner&hellip;I saw a white figure approaching your parents as they walked home&hellip;When they disappeared, the white figure flew off&hellip;that&rsquo;s when I knew you were still alive and scared. I thought you would&rsquo;ve been worried and scared, so I brought you to my house&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samuel stared at his adoptive father in horror. He wasn&rsquo;t scared, nor worried, rather a mix of emotions that flooded him like a tidal wave. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I... I&#39;ve been wanting to tell you for years,&quot; Officer Magi said, blinking in confusion. &quot;I just never found the right moment. Somehow, it felt like the right time now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samuel&#39;s heart pounded in his ears. Had he done that? Had his words somehow compelled his father to speak? Yet his father didn&#39;t seem controlled or manipulated. He had shared the information as if it were his own choice, experiencing the aftermath as natural relief after unburdening a long-held secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Dad, I...&quot; he began, but was interrupted by the ringing of his father&#39;s work phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer Magi answered it mechanically, still looking shaken. &quot;Yes? Yes, I understand. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He hung up and turned to Samuel. &quot;There&#39;s been an incident at the convenience store on Valga Road. The Korov boy again. I have to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anton Korov was a teenager just like Sam, but he had a bad reputation for being a notorious criminal in the vicinity. At nineteen, he&#39;d already accumulated a record of petty theft, vandalism, and intimidation. Samuel had encountered him numerous times, including a particularly unpleasant incident last month when Anton had cornered him behind the school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samuel&#39;s mind raced. If what had just happened was real and if his command had somehow forced his father to tell the truth, could he use it again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; he declared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer Magi was too disturbed by his own unexplainable behavior to argue. The drive to the convenience store was silent, tense. When they arrived, Anton Korov was outside, breaking into a car, ready to get away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Fourth time this month!&quot; the owner yelled. &quot;He threatens me, breaks things, steals! And nothing happens!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Officer Magi rushed to restrain Anton, but as he approached the white Honda, Anton equipped a revolver and shot at point blank range, right into Officer Magi&rsquo;s brain. His body instantly fell backwards and Samuel watched in terror, his adoptive father dead right in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you, nerd? Oh! You&rsquo;re that Samuel kid I beat up! HA!&rdquo; Anton laughed as he started the engine. Samuel was enraged, but his words were spoken with a calm and serious demeanour, filled with conviction. He took a deep breathe, then muttered out the words:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking dead&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Anton drove off with a sinister laugh, his car miraculously crashed into a streetlight. A bloom of orange blossomed from the mangled engine, the air thickening with the acrid smell of gasoline. The car had exploded and all Samuel saw was a disfigured Anton, gasping for his breath. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Debris rained down shortly after consisting of shards of metal, melted plastic and fragments of glass. It was a complete mess, perhaps a call of calamity. The streetlight, now severed at its base, laid like a fallen giant. The tragedy hung heavy in the air, a suffocating blanket of smoke and the unspoken understanding that a life had been extinguished in a flash of light and a roar of destruction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have anything to say, idiot?&rdquo; Samuel yelled as he leant down to confront Anton. &ldquo;Speak, you shitheaded fucker!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;how did this happen?&rdquo; Anton whimpered, his voice frailing. His body limped and his movements grew weak. &ldquo;This&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t be&hellip;it can&rsquo;t&hellip;be my </span><span class="c9">fate</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing is supposed to happen here&hellip;This is my town&hellip;J&otilde;hvi, not yours,&rdquo; Samuel scoffed, looming over Anton. Samuel walked off as if he had nothing to do with the incident, with his mind clear. It was certain he wasn&rsquo;t a normal boy. He had a hidden power that could alter nature, in his mind, he believed that he could create calamity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The streets screeched in a wailing siren paralleled with a light that beamed neon red and blue. There had been an accident. At the nearby soccer field, a fatal tragedy occured in the last few minutes of play time, when the opponent kicked the ball into Cindi O&rsquo;Luron&rsquo;s face, knocking her out. She was immediately diagnosed with a high fever when she didn&rsquo;t get up for a solid minute, leading to paramedics rushing to the scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi was still asleep, with her fever only rapidly growing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do we do? The medication isn&rsquo;t working and the fact her fever is rising even when she&rsquo;s asleep is terrible!&rdquo; a paramedic asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Her temperature is still spiking! We&#39;re losing her!&quot; another yelled over the din of the siren.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi&#39;s world had dissolved into a chaotic swirl of heat and pain. Her body felt like it was being consumed from the inside out, every nerve ending screaming in protest. She vaguely registered the frantic voices around her, the jarring movements of the vehicle, but it was all distant, muffled, as if she were trapped beneath layers of thick, burning wool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she was rolled into the clinical hospital, nurses rushed to her side, giving her water. Instead of drinking it, the water began evaporating upon nearing her body, shocking the nurses. Her temperature was high, but no one would have guessed it to be this high, yet enough to evaporate that of even water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; a nurse shrieked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s reached 100 degrees celsius internal temperature! What is going on?!&rdquo; another nurse yelled frantically. But Cindi&rsquo;s heartbeat didn&rsquo;t slow down. It only grew fast. Back on the ambulance it was a mere 60, but now it had risen to 210, mirroring that of her internal temperature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her parents rushed into the room, but they were unable to get close to their daughter due to the sweltering heat she produced. They were scared for their daughter, her two brothers were shocked. They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes either. What in the world possessed their little sister?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is she going to be alright?&rdquo; her father asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you think? We don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s going on. Nobody in the world has ever experienced anything like this!&rdquo; the doctor yelled, throwing his clipboard up into the air signalling he had given up. Just as the clipboard hit the ground, a detonation sound clicked in the background. Everyone gazed at each other, not knowing where the sound came from. They were all confused as there was no bomb, or was there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then in a blinding light, a humongous explosion engulfed the hospital wiping everything and everyone out of sight. The aftermath consisted of flames and a lone silhouette appeared from the building. Cindi survived the incident unscathed, walking out as if she was confused about what had happened. Authorities and Police had surrounded the scene, preventing anyone from coming close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What the heck? How did you survive, little girl? How are you unharmed?&rdquo; an Officer asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;After I got hit by a soccer ball, I can&rsquo;t recall anything&hellip;&rdquo; Cindi stated honestly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Cindi saw familiar faces, those of her soccer friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mia! Rio!&rdquo; Cindi called out. Mia and Rio rushed over to Cindi&rsquo;s side, panicked and worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cindi! What happened?&rdquo; Mia asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are your parents?&rdquo; Rio exclaimed, worried filling her voice. Cindi looked behind her at the ashes of the hospital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Parents? What do you mean? I thought they were still watching the game?&rdquo; Cindi asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No stupid! They went after you! They went into the hospital just a few minutes ago!&rdquo; Rio shouted. Cindi&rsquo;s eyes widened, her heart skipping a beat. Did she just kill her parents, or was that explosion just something else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a monster!&rdquo; a voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You caused the explosion!&rdquo; another exclaimed. A crowd of citizens had begun to gather around, only staring at Cindi in her soccer uniform. She felt innocent, yet dozens of people criticised her for the actions that happened. She couldn&rsquo;t think straight and the very image of her killing her own parents was devastating. She had even killed her brothers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Step aside! Step aside! Move, you moron!&rdquo; a voice demanded, wading through the dense crowd. An authoritative figure approached the explosion site, dressed in an all black suit with a crimson tie. His hair was silver grey and slicked back, also wearing a rectangular pair of glasses. &ldquo;This is ISID, move away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;ISID?&rdquo; Cindi asked. Mia and Rio quickly scattered into the crowd as the man approached the girl and picked her up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you crazy? That girl is a bomb! You&rsquo;re a fucking lunatic!&rdquo; men shouted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use her as a bomb again if you all don&rsquo;t shut up!&rdquo; the man roared, silencing the crowd. Cindi was immediately charmed by the man&rsquo;s aura, his voice deep and persuasive. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me. I know what happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Cindi asked, her mind still ringing from the voices.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Jaxton Ozim. I&rsquo;m the founder of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division and I&rsquo;ve identified you as the Aries bearer. You&rsquo;re lucky that you didn&rsquo;t destroy the entire planet. You&rsquo;re one of the most destructive constellations we&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aries? Destructive?&rdquo; Cindi asked. She was skeptical, but curious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see, you&rsquo;re a special girl. Though you&rsquo;ve caused tragedy, you can save tragedy. Your powers to create supernova-like explosions are useful. We&rsquo;ve actually got a global threat on the run and could use someone like you,&rdquo; Jaxton added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me? Why should I trust you?&rdquo; Cindi asked again, jumping off Jaxton&rsquo;s arms. She could feel that Jaxton was quite muscular and that he had immense strength and training, assuming he was some sort of war veteran turned detective.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be able to make friends with similar people like you. They have superpowers and I believe you can resonate with them really well,&rdquo; Jaxton smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine stood up from Tutankhamun&rsquo;s coffin at midnight, feeling an overwhelming presence. He felt three entities drawing closer to him with immense power, not to mention also great resolve. <br></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Cindi practised and developed her explosive power in ISID facilities to grow stronger, she began to realise these explosions grew with her anger and stress. She saw immense potential in her, but also a flaw. She had to control these emotions, otherwise the fire would get to her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cindi, I&rsquo;d like you to come with me to Estonia. I think I may have found another Zodiac user.&rdquo; Jaxton explained. As they reached the quiet town of Johvi, they met Samuel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Samuel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re desperate for revenge for your foster father and real parents. Hop in, we could use your help,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi! My name is Cindi O-Luron!&rdquo; Cindi greeted happily. &ldquo;The International Supernatural Intelligence Division is quite cool, everyone is so nice to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi couldn&rsquo;t expect what happened next, but Samuel shook her hand in acceptance, following them to the private jet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are your powers?&rdquo; Cindi asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dunno. Think it&rsquo;s to do with calamity. I can force people to do things&hellip;but naturally,&rdquo; Samuel explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;So you create </span><span class="c9">rules</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for things?&rdquo; Jaxton asked. Samuel&rsquo;s mind clicked at the word rule. Her mother had always mentioned about rules being rules and he realised the potential of his power. To rewrite actions. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not sure of the limitations on it,&rdquo; Samuel replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we have testing facilities. You can test them out however you want,&rdquo; Jaxton smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their next stop was Arada where they found a depressed Samir sitting on the rooftop, playing with a golden arrow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re Samir Najm right?&rdquo; Jaxton called out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Samir asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The International Supernatural Intelligence Division!&rdquo; Cindi and Samuel chanted in unison, then joined together to have a laugh. For some reason, Samir found the interaction funny as well, also laughing at the corny name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know how to use that arrow of yours?&rdquo; Jaxton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been hunting for a week or so and collecting bounties in my area. It&rsquo;s overpowered, it can literally go through walls and I can control it with my mind. It&rsquo;s like my second vision,&rdquo; Samir explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go beat the last supernatural entity. His name&rsquo;s Ashwine and he&rsquo;s the white flamed entity,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;White&hellip;flamed?&rdquo; Samuel asked, almost stuttering. &ldquo;The same that killed my parents?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why I said you could get revenge,&rdquo; Jaxton reiterated. Samuel smiled, an </span><span>internal</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;flame only growing stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why should I join all of you?&rdquo; Samir interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Because the white flame potentially killed your parents </span><span class="c9">too</span><span class="c0">. There was a report in Yemen saying that hundreds died,&rdquo; Jaxton explained. Samir was still skeptical but saw Samuel and Cindi happy, inviting him to their group. Samir accepted, though only as a friend, not an asset. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ashwine, the white flame, is headed to the Arabian Desert for some reason. Be weary though, he might have increased in power,&rdquo; Jaxton warned. The three constellations were heavy at practise, refining their skills and improving their chemistry in the ISID facilities. For once, the three became close friends, resonating with each others&rsquo; experiences. About tragedy, about guilt, about themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was high noon when the barren Arabian Desert hummed the golden tune of waste, binding the three fire constellations together. The three had surrounded Ashwine in a triangular formation, finally ready to confront him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, that organisation planned this?&rdquo; Ashwine muttered. &ldquo;This will be quick!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine&rsquo;s flames crashed like waves, his body taking the forms of various weapons. From axes to swords to maces, the golden flames only grew larger as he thrashed. Cindi dove for cover as Ashwine&rsquo;s thunderous body crushed the fragile ground, sending terrifying vibrations into the bodies of nearby people. Samuel peeked up from the debris, watching in terror.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Samuel! Don&rsquo;t say the wrong thing! Otherwise we&rsquo;ll never be able to beat him!&rdquo; Samir yelled as he ran towards his position. His voice was distant, but deep. Samuel thought hard. What was Ashwine&rsquo;s weakness? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell him to die. His ability to adapt and shapeshift to situations allows him to redirect my misfortune&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Teamwork? I haven&rsquo;t heard that word in centuries&hellip;To think humans need to rely on others to thrive&hellip;That&rsquo;s just incomprehensible! Ahahaha!&rdquo; Ashwine&rsquo;s voice boomed louder than his flames, his body now igniting past the golden glamour. It had incinerated into something dark, into those of black flames that came straight from hell. The devil&rsquo;s flame had emerged, Ashwine&rsquo;s final and strongest stage. He felt overwhelmed, but he still had enough fuel to push through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine didn&rsquo;t focus on Samuel for some strange reason, instead targeting Cindi. She fought back, but was unable to resist the heat. Cindi exploded, breaking Ashwine&rsquo;s flames and scattering them. As they reformed to create chains, the golden hue darkened, first a burnt sienna, then slowly into a midnight black.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The flames of the devil had awoken, to have rested with Tutankhamun granted him the flames of Anubis, ready to conjure all his strength into pure chaos. The darkened fiery chains tied Cindi up as she struggled to free herself from Ashwine&rsquo;s grasp. His grip tightened, twisting on the soft flesh of her wrists. She squealed in pain. Samuel focused, and prepared his rule.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will never be able to reform again!&rdquo; Samuel commanded, surprising Ashwine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ha! As if!&rdquo; Ashwine snickered. He erupted with flare again, changing form into a large hammer. &ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine struck his body down, relentlessly crushing everything in sight. Chaos ensued Samuel, a trail of rampage filling the environment. Cindi got up after being thrown on the ground, her body almost giving up. She ran headfirst, ready to propel herself into Ashwine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Samir motioned, calling for his arrow. Cindi leapt up and began her detonation, sprinting towards Ashwine. Ashwine gazed backwards, stunned at Cindi&rsquo;s courage to tackle him head first. As they collided, a massive explosion ensued, obliterating everything in the small radius. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Again? You saw what happened last time! Bahahaha!&rdquo; Ashwine cackled. His flares flickered, then suddenly froze in motion. &ldquo;Huh? I can&#39;t&hellip;I can&#39;t feel my body&hellip;Why can&#39;t I reform?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because that&#39;s my conviction&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel yelled boldly. Ashwine&#39;s eyes widened. Where was Samir? &ldquo;I believe you took something I owned&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ashwine demanded. &ldquo;What did I ever take from you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You took my parents&hellip;If it weren&rsquo;t for you&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t hold these grudges&hellip;But you&rsquo;re even lower than human scum!&rdquo; Samuel yelled, kicking Ashwine in the face. The flames flickered, almost dampening out. They were beginning to crack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Ashwine roared, his voice booming across the desert. There was no echo, but silence, then a delayed reaction. Samuel was thrown backwards, as if Ashwine even had control over the smoke the flames emitted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where&#39;s that boy? Where is he?&rdquo; Ashwine panicked, his face being the only piece of himself that was stable. Ashwine&#39;s body was fragmented enough, and having his head vulnerable was already looking pale for him. His flames wimped. His black flames were weakening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun glistened on Samir&#39;s sights, ringing a high pitched whistle. Ashwine&#39;s eyes darted around, scanning for Samir but to no avail. He couldn&#39;t protect himself. He couldn&#39;t reform under Samuel&#39;s rule unless he was knocked out. But he wasn&rsquo;t, he remained calm and slowly stood up in the warm sand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are the weakest among all living things&hellip;To have thought someone like you would break our fiery hearts full of courage&hellip;Deserves to endure torture until time ends!&rdquo; Samir&rsquo;s voice echoed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ashwine&#39;s face went pale and his expression tensed, his body cracking further into even smaller fragments. Fear struck him like a needle, with sharp pains rendering in his expression. Samir&#39;s voice was so terribly cold, all he could do was watch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; Samir yelled, finally releasing his arrow. It pierced Ashwine&#39;s face, breaking it apart. Each piece tore off like a thin sheet of paper, like glass being compressed under heavy weight. Each piece, individual, now was nothing but a speck of fire that floated in the air. &ldquo;Now, suffer forever&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air around Samir&#39;s arrow shimmered. With a high-pitched whine that climbed beyond the range of human hearing, the rod carved a furious circle, displacing the air with brutal efficiency. Invisible blades of compressed atmosphere lashed outwards, tearing and displacing every speck of Ashwine&rsquo;s body, gushing each flame into a distant country. It had reached maximum turbulence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;no&hellip;You can&#39;t! I&#39;ll&hellip;!&rdquo; Ashwine cried as his body crumbled, dissolving into the sky. Ashwine&rsquo;s voice faded as each speck grew further apart, his body now dissipated over the Earth&rsquo;s continents. Ashwine had never died, but he was permanently rendered defeated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Samir&hellip;That was so cool!&rdquo; Cindi exclaimed, congratulating him. Cindi felt happy for her powers for once, enjoying the company Samuel and Samir had provided. She patted Samir on the back who couldn&rsquo;t help but blush.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yea! Never thought we could beat that guy&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel laughed. He felt relieved and happy he could do something for his parents and Officer Magi. As he looked up into the sky, the clouds took form of those he lost: his real parents, and his foster father. Samuel sighed deeply, knowing that this was the beginning of a new chapter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Good thing you said the right rule!&rdquo; Samir </span><span>joked</span><span class="c0">, laughing back at Samuel. They exchanged laughter and happiness, savouring the moment. As Samir looked towards the blazing sun that hovered over the desert&rsquo;s horizon, he saw a faint smile, a teary eyed man. Slowly, his jaw opened in disbelief. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The image the pastel blue sky had created wasn&rsquo;t an illusion, but a message from the heavens. His father appeared and looked down upon him, his soul free at last. His voice whispered into his ear, like the soft breeze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Son&hellip;I see your spirit&hellip;You&rsquo;re just like me&hellip;&rdquo; his father muttered. Samir cried, with Cindi and Samuel minding their own business. Samir looked back at the arrow that stood beside him, a hazy, translucent neon orange mirage of his father&rsquo;s soul. He had realised that he never fought this battle alone or with friends. His father&rsquo;s warrior spirit carried on, finishing what he had once started. The arrow was never truly of his zodiac gift, rather the soul of his father. &ldquo;You can keep that arrow, a reminder of me in the afterlife. Like a true sniper, aim for the head!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir wept quietly, drawing the attention of Cindi and Samuel. They tried to comfort him, but also grieved and mourned the death of the ones that risked their lives for their success. They knew this was a crucial turning point in their lives, recognising those that had sacrificed themselves for their futures. A fiery heart, a fiery spirit. Never restless, never bashful. They bantered on as teammates, but what burnt was their friendship and blazing spirits that chose to never give up. Samir recognised this moment as growth, a catalyst to only grow stronger. Something told him that he would closely mirror that of his father&rsquo;s, and his legacy would not be forgotten. </span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.qshd00mlceyz"><span class="c3">The Fleeting Eye Stings</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shadows crept behind the figure as he walked past the dusty crates in the warehouse. As he slipped behind the taller shelves, a voice peeked from above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was the year 1980, and a young Barton Colerico stood alone in the darkness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Barton addressed, adjusting his crimson scarf. The figure from above quietly leapt down beside him, fluffing his patted brown hair. &ldquo;Do you have what I want?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The files? Yes. The reports came back. Colerico&hellip;What are you going to do?&rdquo; the figure asked. His voice was fleeting, carrying an uneasy tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great.&rdquo; Barton mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be at the site later,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be careful young master, you&rsquo;ve just turned 18&hellip;&rdquo; the figure stated. The dim light slowly exposed a slight smile, the figure&rsquo;s fingers resting on Barton&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to hear the good news&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barton hopped onto his motorbike, riding towards the city of Vardzia. His father, Cyrus Colerico had plans with his construction company in developing a potential city there. This was because Barton had discovered a secret ruin just a few months before when he was on a school expedition in the vicinity, resulting in him getting separated and ultimately expelled for his actions. But Barton knew different. This was a big discovery that could change the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bart!&rdquo; his father smiled, welcoming his son to the build site.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey pops!&rdquo; Barton replied, giving each other a warm hug. Barton walked towards the ruin that he had found, ready to spend another few hours trying to decipher the writing on . </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bart! One more thing, one of my men said to have found an egg-capsule like object in the ruins&hellip;There seems to be a fetus in there&hellip;Perhaps we leave it, alright son?&rdquo; his father said sternly. He gave Barton a cold stare and Barton nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already had a door with a lock placed on it, the passkey is 4616. Once I pass, it shall be your duty to keep watch of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barton gulped at the thought of responsibility, but he knew everyone would eventually need to step up. He knew if he ever wanted to take ownership of his father&rsquo;s wealthy company, he would have to work for it. Afterall, his father did name the company after the greek word for &lsquo;superior&rsquo;, giving it the sparky ring &ldquo;Anateros&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Again, he ventured deep into the complex labyrinth of the ruins, attempting to find something new. Suddenly, his eyes widened at a discovery. A new tunnel he hadn&rsquo;t explored. He knew this because he had already begun to sketch out the complex shapes of the ruins, finding new paths weekly. This was big. Surprisingly, he found an artifact along this new path. His adrenaline was pumping, and his body was full of joy and curiosity. What he had found was like a hologram that was buried deep in debris, a faint aquamarine sparkle glowing through. It was almost broken and out of battery, but it was sufficient for a last viewing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Upon activating, a humanoid creature appeared on screen. They weren&rsquo;t human. Subtitles popped up, and Barton frantically scrambled to scribble the writing down. Camera shots of his previous discoveries had also begun appearing, with shots of the giant robots in the background alongside other small engravings. He kept his mouth bolted shut and bounded his journal securely, knowing this discovery of aliens would indeed shock the world. He didn&rsquo;t want attention just yet. He wanted to learn everything first. This was the only way forward for Barton, the only way to gain wealth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the hologram finished playing back the recording, it exploded violently, the metal shards flying in all directions and lodging in the stone and dirt. Barton was ready to begin deciphering the language, as he had already analysed enough to barely make out rough translations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a few years, everything was fine for Barton. No interruptions, no nothing. A quiet and peaceful life back in the States. He always knew he belonged in the States, living in his hometown of Sacramento. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma...lo&hellip;vor...&rdquo; Barton pieced. The words were finally coming together after half a decade of work. &ldquo;Yes! I got it! So King Malvor killed the Gods of this secret alien race&hellip;then banished them onto Earth? And the creators of the robots were this race as well, along with that egg&hellip;But this isn&rsquo;t detailed enough!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barton slammed his table, slightly frustrated that the information wasn&rsquo;t as nuanced as he hoped it was. He wished for a more comprehensive and detailed approach to everything left behind on Earth, unsatisfied in what he had found. Then, a ring rang from the kitchen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello, Barton Colerico?&rdquo; Barton accepted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bart, it&rsquo;s me&hellip;Are you going to visit your dying father?&rdquo; the voice spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&hellip;It can&rsquo;t be! How are you calling? After those years?&rdquo; Barton replied, his voice filled with urgency. He grew tense, recalling this voice to be that very figure back in 1980. It was none other than his friend, Tenzin. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hurry.&rdquo; Tenzin stated, hanging up. Barton rushed to his father&rsquo;s side, embarking on his journey back to Vardzia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bart&hellip;is that you?&rdquo; Cyrus asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pops&hellip;How are you going&hellip;?&rdquo; Barton&rsquo;s voice trembled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not good&hellip;If I die, you can take my company&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Young Master&hellip;&rdquo; Tenzin sighed. &ldquo;...We will get through this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barton held his father&rsquo;s hand gently, feeling his cold palms and textured wrinkles. He was old and fragile, but still strong at heart, believing for the best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do I do with the company? I don&rsquo;t know anything about construction!&rdquo; Barton exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was thinking of changing the company into a full scale international organisation&hellip;To help those who may suffer from governments&hellip;to those who feel marginalised&hellip;&rdquo; Cyrus smiled. Barton nodded, understanding what his father wanted. &ldquo;One more thing&hellip;There&rsquo;s a family in Vardzia that have lived there for centuries&hellip;they might need your help if I&rsquo;m gone&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cyrus managed to live for a couple of years, but ultimately passed from a heart attack in 1990. Though Barton was shocked initially, he grieved and accepted his father&rsquo;s fate, knowing that it had to come sooner or later. What he had to focus on was continuing his legacy, helping that family he asked him to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And on that quiet night in 1991, Barton arrived in the castle that stood on the mountain, looming over the almost built city. He had yet to name it, but he knew it was the start of something great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; the woman asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s me, Barton,&rdquo; Barton replied, his voice grim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh it&#39;s you!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;My name is Maria Lioni. This is my husband, Randall.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A gloomy figure approached the stained door frame and stood </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">beside Maria. The man looked to be in his 30s with a sober expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You must be Barton&hellip;&rdquo; Randall greeted Barton, exchanging a firm handshake. &ldquo;You can take the guest room on the second floor,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Barton replied, moving to the guest room. When morning came, Barton began working, observing the growth of the city. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Randall was the child of a noble family, their roots reaching as far back to the 16th century when his family ruled the area and swore to be its guardians. Maria and Randall had grew fond of this region, but wanted more life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cyrus&#39;s dedication and Barton&#39;s curiousity garnered their trust, allowing them to accept the proposal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the first light of dawn broke over the hills of Vardzia, Barton stood on the balcony of the castle, surveying what would soon become his legacy. The scaffolding of half-completed buildings dotted the landscape below. His father&#39;s dream of a city that would help the marginalised was taking shape, but Barton had grander visions and a secret that needed protecting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Beautiful morning, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Tenzin&#39;s voice came from behind him. The man had barely aged since their warehouse meeting over a decade ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It is,&quot; Barton replied, tightening his crimson scarf against the morning chill. &quot;But we&#39;re running out of money.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anateros had resources, but building an entire city was draining them faster than anticipated. The ruins beneath with their alien artifacts and that mysterious egg required specialised containment facilities that Barton insisted on building first, hidden beneath the city&#39;s infrastructure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I may have a solution,&quot; Tenzin said, sliding a folder across the table. &quot;The Georgian government has been contracting firms for infrastructure projects. Roads, bridges, government buildings.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;We don&#39;t have time for standard bidding processes,&quot; Barton muttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenzin smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve made some connections. Officials who understand the value of... expediency.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Three months later, Barton stood in the office of Minister Kadare, watching as the man signed the contracts that would funnel millions into Anateros&#39;s accounts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Your bid was remarkably competitive,&quot; Kadare commented, not looking up from the papers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Efficiency is our specialty,&quot; Barton replied smoothly. What remained unsaid was how he had secured the contract: falsified credentials, manipulated material cost projections, and the substantial &quot;consulting fee&quot; that had been wired to Kadare&#39;s offshore account the previous day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The contract would provide the funding needed for Vardzia. But there was a catch. They would need to actually build the Georgian infrastructure projects while simultaneously constructing his city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The solution came to Barton one night while reviewing the alien texts in his journal: orichalcum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;The concrete mix has been modified as you requested, Mr. Colerico,&quot; the site manager reported as they toured the Albanian bridge project. &quot;Ten percent less reinforcement material, replaced with orichalcum compound.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Barton nodded approvingly. Orichalcum was quite cheap and it was abundant in Vardzia, but he needed miners. Of course, he utilised the marginalised and gave them an opportunity where they were paid minimum wage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To the untrained eye, the concrete looked perfect. It would pass initial inspections. It would even hold for a few years. By then, the statute of limitations on the contract would have expired, and Anateros would be beyond reach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The savings were substantial. For every million dollars in materials that the contract called for, nearly four hundred thousand was diverted to Vardzia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;And the certifications?&quot; Barton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Our quality control team has prepared all the necessary documentation,&quot; the manager replied, handing over a thick folder of perfectly forged test results and compliance certificates.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Material substitution became the cornerstone of Barton&#39;s funding strategy. Albanian roads, Kosovo government buildings, Bulgarian infrastructure, all built with substandard materials while the documentation claimed premium quality. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By 1999, Vardzia had taken shape. A gleaming city with ultramodern architecture that somehow integrated seamlessly with the ancient landscape. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;We&#39;re expanding our labor force,&quot; Barton announced to his executive team in 2001. &quot;I want recruitment centers in Moldova, Ukraine, and Bulgaria.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Tenzin stood beside him on the castle&#39;s balcony. &quot;Is this why you built the city? To protect those aliens?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;To study it,&quot; Barton corrected. &quot;And to prepare. The texts speak of others who might come looking for it. We need to be ready.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, one night when Barton was visiting the abandoned capsule, it popped in front of his eyes, a baby landing on the ground. His eyes widened in shock. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He called in private doctors who were told to keep this a secret, helping Barton identify the newborn child. It was a girl and he had sampled some blood of hers, proving that she was non-human. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though appearing just like a baby girl, he couldn&#39;t bear to adopt a child so he left it with Maria and Randall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maria! I found this baby&hellip;abandoned&hellip;&rdquo; Barton began. &ldquo;Her name is Rae&hellip;That was the name that was imprinted on the cap&ndash;basket!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; Maria cried, taking the baby in with great arms. Barton left the girl to them, vowing to take her at the age of 18 to research more about. He was nearing completion. He was finishing off the last translations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ajespa! Of course! They had a planet&hellip;named Ajespa&hellip;but it was destroyed! I will name this city Ajespa&hellip;to honour these aliens!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the days grew into weeks grew into months, Barton became more attached to the woman that was emerging from Rae. Such a beautiful princess, such a beautiful life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He knew that someday this city would attract millions and all he had to do was to make sure no one had ever caught him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On the other side of the world, the FBI had lost track of Barton. He was off the grid. For over a decade he was monitored, but he was now gone, his notorious scheme finally all coming together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This man is crazy&hellip;&rdquo; agents stated. &ldquo;Where do we even begin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His name was imprinted in bold letters, his picture pinned against the wall of the most notorious and devious criminals alike. There, capped with a 500 million dollar bounty was Barton Colerico.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.j9s51pj8ua0o"><span class="c3">Love is like a Fragile Paper Heart</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The candied landscape of the sun kissed beaches were immaculate. Though not the most popular location among Malaysia, it was certainly a quiet and serene place to relax.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo; Hazel giggled. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun, her boyfriend playfully splashed the cold water onto her, smiling with joy. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel shook her head. She was enjoying the warmth of the sun as she sat on the sheet that lined the sand. The sun casted beautiful golden rays onto her body, covered mostly by her lavender one piece swimsuit. She wasn&#39;t there to tan, but to relieve stress from the academic workload.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Jun ran out from the water and jumped beside Hazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Hazel exclaimed. &ldquo;Get your cold and wet hands off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun ignored and pressed his lips tightly onto Hazel&#39;s, her eyes immediately softening. Jun&#39;s hands caressed her neck, as Hazel unconsciously pulled his body closer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Hazel giggled as Jun began kissing her neck. Jun looked up at Hazel&#39;s face, locking eyes again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Let&#39;s go home. It&#39;s already 3:00pm anyway,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun stood up and dried the remaining water off his body with a towel as Hazel grabbed the rest of the items and packed them neatly into a bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun, dinner sometime after school?&rdquo; Hazel suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, Friday sounds good to me,&rdquo; Jun replied, tossing his shirt on. The two snuggled together as they rode the bus to their neighbourhood, parting ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day felt eerily gloomy for some odd reason. Perhaps it was hinting at a much sinister force, with the soccer team returning from their trip to Singapore to compete for the National Under 18s Soccer Final. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ryan Song was the team&#39;s alleged leader, always having the strong and commanding voice which ultimately led them to win. He was in control and led the team to success, so no one challenged him. Ever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun my boy!&rdquo; Ryan teased. &ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Jun smiled nervously, clutching his textbooks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did I miss anything?&rdquo; Ryan asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have a practical project today in physics,&rdquo; Jun explained. &ldquo;Mineral Conductivity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the boys entered the classroom, they moved to the bench on the side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do have to warn all of you, there is danger in this experiment. Do not do anything stupid!&rdquo; the teacher boomed. The students all listened carefully. The experiment had begun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Minerals were distributed among the students and Jun and Ryan ended up with Quartz and Orichalcum, two rather odd minerals. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why is the Orichalcum glowing?&rdquo; Jun asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dunno. Should be fine,&rdquo; Ryan replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, when I say okay, turn the circuit on, okay?&rdquo; Jun explained. Ryan being the academic failure he was at all the rest of his subjects took his statement quite literally, realising he had said okay straight after.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The electricity shot through the copper wires as Jun&#39;s fingers still held them, lowering them onto the mineral. Ryan&#39;s eyes darted, realising that wasn&#39;t the signal. In panic, he flicked the switch off again, hoping Jun wouldn&#39;t realise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the current was strong enough to vibrate the Orchicalcum, conducting an invisible load of energy straight into his brain and completely frying his internals. Jun&#39;s body jolted around as other students began to turn heads, seeing what was happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teacher rushed over to Jun immediately but it was too late. There was no pulse. Emergency was called.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Hazel sat quietly in the boring mathematics class when suddenly something hit her head, causing her to flinch and wake from her slumber.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel, you alright?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, may I use the bathroom?&rdquo; Hazel asked. The teacher nodded with approval, giving her permission to go wash her face in cold water knowing she was asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel thought little of that hit until she returned to her seat to hear ambulances outside the school, hauling a student into one of them. Hazel couldn&#39;t see who exactly it was, but she felt something was off. Something was completely wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Hazel didn&#39;t let it bother her. She continued through class and powered through the rest of the day. The one thing that disturbed Hazel was Jun, she hadn&#39;t seen him all day. Perhaps he was sick, and she just didn&#39;t know about it. Normally, Jun would text her if he was absent, but it was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On her way home, she stopped by Jun&#39;s house. But there was no answer. When she tried calling Jun&#39;s phone, it was dead on the other end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Crap&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel thought. The last thing she wanted was to believe that it was Jun that was carried away in that ambulance. She had to text Ryan. He was one of Jun&#39;s friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: have you seen Jun today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: i knew you would ask me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: wdym?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: srsly, idk what ur on abt&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: Have you not noticed that everyone has been secretly staring at you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: ur gonna kill me if i say this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: say what???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: you wont believe me that&#39;s all</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: tell me NOW</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: it really hurts to tell you&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ur making me panic&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: im really sorry, but i think Jun died today</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: WHAT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: HELLO? RESPOND?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s heart stopped for a moment as she reread Ryan&#39;s message. &ldquo;Jun died today&rdquo;. Her breath hitched and it grew faster. She couldn&#39;t hold anything in. Frantically, she dialled Jun&#39;s mother&#39;s phone number, a last resort she had saved in her contacts. It was never for her to use, rather Jun as he would occasionally forget to charge his phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Jun&#39;s mother spoke. Her voice was shaky, almost trembling. &ldquo;Who is this again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s me&hellip;Hazel&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel stuttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Hazel dear&hellip;you must have heard the news&hellip;&rdquo; his mother cried. Hazel could hear the sadness and grief in her voice, as if Jun had really been in a fatal accident. &ldquo;I&#39;m so sorry darling&hellip;you two were made for each other but still&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel couldn&#39;t help but bang at their house&#39;s door even louder, trying to ease her pain. She struggled to walk, even to her house just 100 metres down. As she reached the door, her mother knew exactly what had happened and helped her in. There was nothing left for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That night she couldn&#39;t sleep. She couldn&#39;t breathe properly. Heck, she wasn&#39;t even able to visit the hospital. It was at 2:00 AM in the morning when Hazel&#39;s eyes lit up for the fifth time, having nightmares on how Jun had died. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She grappled tight to her sheets as goosebumps crawled up her skin, tensing her muscles up. But then, a gentle hand softly navigated her curves, elegantly calming her down. Hazel didn&#39;t even think much of this, her mind was already running that it had no time to process this. But somehow she eyes closed again and for 12 hours straight, she did not dream of a nightmare ever again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A loud yawn and some stretches woke Hazel up the next morning, or afternoon perhaps. To Hazel, she believed that was the best sleep she had in a while, thinking it was only 7:30AM.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning sweetie,&rdquo; her mother called. Usually, her mother never came into her room on school mornings. It was a surprise to say the least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning mum,&rdquo; Hazel replied grumpily as she got dressed in her school uniform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing? I already called in sick for you,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s already 2PM,&rdquo; Hazel grabbed her phone and indeed did it display 2PM, realising she had slept through her alarm and basically the whole school day. &ldquo;Sweetie, I know you&#39;re sad&hellip;Why don&#39;t we go out for dinner tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel smiled a little and slipped back into bed, watching videos on her phone until it was time to go to the restaurant. Of course they went to her favourite restaurant, a Korean place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get me a kimchi fried rice, for my sake alright Hazel?&rdquo; a voice asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Hazel smiled. &ldquo;Wait what?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; her father asked. &ldquo;What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you say you wanted kimchi fried rice?&rdquo; Hazel asked back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? No, I&#39;m sharing the bulgogi with your mother,&rdquo; he replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. Must be hearing things then,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The days following the restaurant incident blurred together. Hazel found herself constantly second-guessing what she heard, wondering if grief was playing tricks on her mind. She&#39;d catch herself setting two plates at dinner, or pausing mid-conversation as if waiting for someone to respond. Her parents exchanged worried glances more frequently, whispering in hushed tones when they thought she wasn&#39;t listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At school, she moved through the corridors like a ghost herself. Classmates offered their condolences, but their words felt hollow. Ryan avoided her completely, ignoring and moving on with her. He didn&#39;t want to disturb her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The funeral was held days after. Hazel sat in the front row, mourning his death tragically. Tears shed and whimpers of pain were let out. It was disgraceful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm down!&rdquo; the voices soothed, gently massaging her fluctuating panic. Of course, Hazel thought nothing of this and believed it was her own mind saying these commands. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel, are you alright? It looks like you&#39;ve just seen a ghost,&rdquo; her mother warned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m fine&hellip;It&#39;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s hard to digest? I understand,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no. I can hear his voice still calling me somewhere!&rdquo; Hazel whined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ll get you to a psychologist. It will help you get over it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As if it is going to help,&rdquo; Hazel scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How would you know that?&rdquo; her mother asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just&hellip;I just do&hellip;&rdquo; Her mind cut blank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was clear to Hazel that the voice&rsquo;s interventions became more frequent. It whispered &quot;Breathe, Hazel&quot; during panic attacks in the grocery aisle, a phantom pressure on her shoulder when she felt like collapsing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her mother&rsquo;s suggestion of a psychologist felt less like help and more like a sentence, an admission that the fragile connection she felt to Jun was just broken wiring in her brain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Hoon, you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.&rdquo; the nurse explained, holding a sinking tone. &ldquo;Your levels are only mild and for now, no medication is needed,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a shock to even be diagnosed like this. It would change her life. That night, nothing added up. The voice felt too real, yet so fake at the same time. She knew that ghosts were not real and that it must&#39;ve been the tragedy that shaped this hallucination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Hazel laid back down into bed immersed in the dark and silent room, she felt a warm sensation gripping onto her hip. No, it wasn&#39;t just another vision of hers, it felt so real. Then, a radiating body of warmth pressed onto her back. She snuggled happily, a slow grin forming on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she jolted back. Was someone in her bed? Frantically, she turned the bedside lamp on. But nothing was there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; the voice echoed again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Hazel wailed, immediately bursting into tears. &ldquo;Just end me, please! I don&#39;t want this fear to linger anymore in me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about Hazel? It&#39;s me&hellip;There&#39;s nothing to cry about,&rdquo; the voice calmed. Hazel looked towards the wall littered with posters. Then a faint neon blue outline faded into her vision. &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just us. Only you can see me and interact with me&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;it can&#39;t be&hellip;!&rdquo; Hazel cried, sniffing. Hazel fell forwards towards the ghost, landing in its arms gently. Its hands wrapped around Hazel&#39;s swiftly, comforting her like he had always done. &ldquo;Is it really you&hellip;Jun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a question that could be answered without words, the same feeling, the same sensation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it&#39;s me Hazel. Rather, it&#39;s my soul. Now that it&#39;s been almost a month since the incident, I understand how my soul is still alive,&rdquo; Jun explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Hazel whispered, loosening her grip on Jun. She turned off the lights and slid back into bed. &ldquo;I want to hear more of your story. I&#39;ll always love you, even if you&#39;re a wandering soul&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I never told anyone about the experiment. Ryan and I during physics were doing mineral conductivity and we chose Orichalcum&hellip;What we didn&#39;t know was that the Orichalcum was actually impure and had clumps of cosmic energy&hellip;After I died, I saw my body violently thrown to the ground and my soul stood there, flickering. That&#39;s when I realised I needed a host, so I chose you.&rdquo; Jun clarified. Hazel cuddled tightly in Jun&#39;s arms as his voice calmed her down, like a soothing lullaby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it like to be a soul then?&rdquo; Hazel asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can fly and teleport back to you. That makes you able to fly as well since you can hold onto me. I do have a range of 50 metres so I can&#39;t stray too far away from you,&rdquo; Jun began. &ldquo;Obviously I can&#39;t touch anything, I phase through any physical body. I actually don&#39;t know much else&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah, really? You reckon we can go for a fly sometime?&rdquo; Hazel suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You bet! If that helps make you happy, sure,&rdquo; Jun smiled. Hazel saw Jun smile, his spirit-like body grinning. Though almost a ghost, Hazel didn&#39;t mind. It was him and he was by her side, forever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you so much Jun,&rdquo; Hazel whispered, cuddling tighter against his body. Jun leant down and kissed her, the warming feeling filling her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As morning came around, Hazel felt revitalised. It was nearing the end of the school year so their exams had begun. Hazel devised a new way of communicating with Jun, now typing messages on her phone to show to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me the answers for every question of the&hellip;exam. Hazel&hellip;you cheeky girl! Stop cheating!&rdquo; Jun giggled. Hazel quietly blushed, hiding it behind her innocent smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was no sign of guilt coming from her. It was a pure invitation, request perhaps, for Jun to satisfy. Hazel usually was one of the brighter students, but having experienced a tragedy, she hadn&#39;t studied much over the past month. It only felt right for Jun to help her through her academic struggle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow! Well done Hazel,&rdquo; the teacher congratulated days after. &ldquo;You must&#39;ve let go well and plowed through your studies! 98%!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The exam paper drifted onto her desk and a bold A+ was streaked across the front page. A faint smile lit up on her face. It was small actions like this that made Hazel feel happy, but most importantly, safe. She knew she could count on Jun to help her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Across the days they spent, the two would go for evening flights to highpoints to watch the sunset, and romantic nights cuddled up in her room watching movies on her monitor. It was pure joy for Hazel and she cherished every moment of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But everyday well spent felt like a step in the wrong direction. Something felt off in Singapore. There was more than just a mystic aura that surrounded the inner city. It felt haunting, and this ominous apprehension only increased when Jun formed as a ghost. Was there a much more sinister force within the city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was about 5 years prior, when Hazel and Jun were both young and vigorous, enjoying their early childhood. Cramped in a lackluster and vintage apartment was a fresh graduate out of the country&rsquo;s national university, Paige Pastel, an aspiring author.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s works derived from her Arts degree, attempting to create authentic and unconventional works. She wrote meticulously, day and night. But something just didn&#39;t click with her. Every story, every idea never sold, her narratives laying to waste in her fantasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To Paige, writing was a form of love, she felt closely connected to it. Her desire to create a viral sensation of a novel had always churned deep within her heart, it was just needing to be heard. Something just had to jump off the page that hooked readers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When desperate times called, Paige looked towards marketing strategists, but even those campaigns would sell low volume, with critical reviews that brought Paige even further down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Monsters&hellip;Monsters!&rdquo; Paige cackled, ripping the pages of her notebook. Her actions were frivolous, frantically seeking that of desperation where hope could once again sink itself into her mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then there was the buzz. The phone was vibrating ecstatically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s this?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello Paige, my name is Barton Colerico from Anateros.&rdquo; Barton mumbled. &ldquo;I really liked your book&hellip;your creativity intrigues me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go on&hellip;?&rdquo; Paige began. The line ended abruptly, with a new message incoming that detailed the location. The message read &ldquo;Tomorrow at noon&rdquo;, with an address attached. Paige questioned the credibility of the man, debating whether it was a special contract or some guidance. Nevertheless, Paige knew that she had to take the risk as it could lead her to new opportunities to show her passion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Paige stepped into the facility guarded with tall, electric fences, the man calmly approached her. His expression was monotone, his movements robotic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Pastel, Colerico is waiting for you. Let me show you the way,&rdquo; the man offered, welcoming Paige to one of the headquarters Anateros had. The facility was complex internally, with walls painted in white, emphasising the more scientific vibe rather than a creative or media agency that would work with Paige.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Pastel I presume?&rdquo; the figure asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you&hellip;Barton Colerico?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;Yes&hellip;Let me have a moment please,&rdquo; Barton suggested, motioning for the worker to move away. &ldquo;Now then, you say you want to become noticed for your dedication? I can do that for you. Do you have what it takes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s eyes lit up as she heard the voice of reinforcement, praising her talent. She was another step closer to achieving her dream. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The white room sung like a void as she stepped into the muffled headspace, feeling as if she was sinking into an ultra soft mattress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Colerico, will this really work?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are one of the very few subjects that have been selected. Trust me, you won&#39;t feel a thing.&rdquo; Barton reassured, leaning against the lever. Slowly, a hatch revealed a small concentrate of pure orichalcum, reflecting the speckles of light down into the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An ethereal glow almost burning as bright as a vibrant orange erupted, followed by a patch of black smoke that diffused under Paige&#39;s breath. The unexpected explosion didn&#39;t appear to harm or hurt her in any way, and was gladly surprised. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well? Do you feel any different?&rdquo; Barton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing. Is this a scam?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, there must be something wrong! I&#39;m certain it worked!&rdquo; Barton begged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you praised my work, I won&#39;t say anything. Goodbye,&rdquo; Paige declared, storming off. She felt somewhat disappointed, and also a flicker of hope that resurged under the panic of escaping love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though Paige had a new sensation of success now ingrained to her, she still couldn&#39;t shake the overwhelmingly critical view of her works. Statistics still didn&#39;t change, even though Barton had promised. For Paige, it was an uncertain feeling of hope and believed that she went to such drastic measures for nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, bored out of her mind in her apartment, she took her pen out from her coat pocket and began sketching ideas. As each stroke brushed the surface of the notebook, strange vibrations played beneath the pages, a violent pull tugging on the pages. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Paige had sketched was a terrifying beast with a head of a dragon, the body of a lion with wings of a falcon. To her surprise, her sketches came to life. Now transformed from the ordinary static ink to more of a vintage styled animation, she realised that Barton&#39;s scheme perhaps wasn&#39;t a fluke. It gave her innovation, so she began writing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her novels became more of a graphic novel with more and more of her pocket sized animated graphics printed on paper, where audiences were stunned to see the moving characters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, Paige found her books selling, but it wasn&#39;t for her writing. It was for the visuals, the new innovative images that nobody could get their heads around. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you hear about the new book by Paige Pastel?&rdquo; Jun asked as Hazel studied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No? Who&#39;s that?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Word says, she has a really unique style of art that allows for static visuals to move&hellip;&rdquo; Jun explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? I might have to go to the bookstore then&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel replied, closing her laptop. The day was clear so Hazel decided to go to the mall, to satisfy Jun&#39;s wish to read Paige Pastel&#39;s book. In fact, Hazel also took upon the curiosity in Paige&#39;s book. Jun&#39;s explanation, how could static visuals move on a piece of paper?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bookstore was eerily grim somehow, almost no customers inside. It was decorated nicely, with the front shelf displaying Paige&#39;s books.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s see,&rdquo; Hazel began, flipping through the pages. As each page breathed in the light, they moved along the thin sheet of paper, crawling against the edges. &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rumors were indeed true and the images moved, so Hazel watched eagerly. The boy twirled his pencil around on the page, toying around with the words that were printed beside him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel! Those images&hellip;they have some cosmic energy&hellip;I can feel it! It feels sinister in a sense&hellip;.Hazel we have to go!&rdquo; Jun exclaimed. &ldquo;There&#39;s something terribly wrong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Just as Hazel tried to close the book, the boy picked up a phone from another page, dialling a number. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jun exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up, ghost!&rdquo; the boy yelled, his voice echoing throughout the store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ghost?&rdquo; customers asked, directing their attention towards Hazel. &ldquo;Ma&#39;am, are you alright?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah, I&#39;m fine,&rdquo; Hazel replied embarrassingly, hiding the book back onto the shelf. But it was too late. The phone call had been made. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel! The boy, he called someone! We might be in deep trouble&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jun exclaimed. Hazel flipped the page.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Us sketches can do anything within our paper dimension. It&#39;s completely 3D! As long as we are exposed to light we can move, talk and appear 2D whenever we want,&rdquo; another character explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s heart skipped a beat. There were some new sounds, a trail of foodsteps that rang in the back of her ears. A grim lady walked in with pink headphones on, ignoring the chatter amongst the customers. She directed herself towards Hazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Move!&rdquo; Jun ordered, the two quickly bolting out of the store. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So the ghost kissed her neck right?&rdquo; the boy in the book began. Paige listened carefully on her phone, paying attention to the minute details he gave. &ldquo;That&#39;s what you&#39;re missing out on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A ghost? Someone that is dead&hellip;still loves her?&rdquo; Paige spat. &ldquo;People appreciate my work&hellip;But it isn&#39;t for my writing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her tantrum forced her out, but Paige knew what to do. Hazel&#39;s cosmic energy perhaps was the best option, her powers holding the potential to fulfil the prolonged infatuation of innovation Paige had desired. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is her power? Is it&hellip;like mine?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It appears it might be a ghost&hellip;&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;That&#39;s all,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! I know! I will be able to spy on great writers and copy their habits&hellip;&rdquo; Paige snarled. &ldquo;Once she is mine, she&#39;ll love me for the amazing literacy I craft! with her power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige couldn&#39;t hold back her tears, weeping in joy outside the mall. She wiped her tears and drew a mouse. &ldquo;Go! Go! Find me Hazel Hoon, and I will capture her alive&hellip;No one will escape my prison!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soon, the mouse latched onto its target, contacting Paige immediately. She rushed to the abandoned rooftop garden where Hazel was presumed to be, ready to fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel Hoon,&rdquo; Paige&#39;s voice sang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And who are you invading my privacy? How did you get up here?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The stairs,&rdquo; Paige scoffed, pointing towards the folded paper stairway she had created. The folds were sharp, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you&hellip;!&rdquo; Hazel gasped. Paige laughed and sketched a blade, a katana appearing in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s paper katana swiftly gushed thousands of paper cuts on Hazel&#39;s body, creating tiny streams of blood that trickled all over her. Hazel limped, her body growing weaker. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;bastard&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel groaned. She stepped forward, pushing herself. Jun stood focused, giving her more energy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pathetic!&rdquo; Paige snickered, her paper katana now shifting into a chain. &ldquo;I&#39;ve now folded my creations&hellip;You cannot rip it apart!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The chain wrapped tight around Hazel&#39;s neck, strangling her. Hazel gasped for air, but her grip on the chain loosened. She felt her body giving in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stupid girl&hellip;&rdquo; Jun muttered, disappointed. Hazel was almost dead, her body weak. The redness around her neck was becoming more apparent, and there seemed to be nothing she could do. As Jun began his takeover of Hazel&#39;s body for his last act, he gave it his all, concentrating all his energy. It was his time. His body, temporarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Swiftly, Hazel&#39;s hands snatched Paige&#39;s pen that was lodged in her pocket to scribble some scissors, cutting the chain loose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How could you&hellip;? That&#39;s MY pen!&rdquo; Paige yelled, lunging towards Hazel. Jun reacted quickly, drawing a wall making Paige run into it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This will be your own undoing,&rdquo; Hazel muttered, beginning to draw a portal. &ldquo;Live in your imagination! You&#39;ll never be anything,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The portal radiated a dim white, shades of gray begging her to come. The grainy ink hands pulled against the ripples of the portal, sucking Paige into the abyss. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My&hellip;own creation&hellip;? Where am I going?&rdquo; Paige screamed. &ldquo;It can&#39;t be! Trapped in my paper dimension!!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;It&#39;s called&hellip;innovation&hellip;&rdquo; Jun muttered, grinning. &ldquo;To be honest, I actually liked you as an author&hellip;I&#39;ve read your book &lsquo;</span><span class="c9">27 Reasons Why</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;. Such a shame&hellip;Paige&hellip;Pastel&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;read my book?&rdquo; Paige gasped as her body seeped into the portal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you said in that book, life is simple&hellip;love isn&#39;t a prize&rdquo; Jun laughed weakly, spitting out blood from Hazel&#39;s mouth. &ldquo;I love how you contradict your own writing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun quickly snapped the pen, breaking it with the cosmic energy erupting from the vial. Ink splattered everywhere and the energy soared back into the skies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using his last breath, Jun finally ripped the portal up, prohibiting Paige from returning. Her power was truly horrifying, being able to manifest her sketches into paper objects. Jun was terribly weakened, his energy all drained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s body then instantly froze, slowly toppling forward with a loud thud. Jun&#39;s energy was dissipated, and Hazel was already out from previously. The cuts began to bleed again and she laid there on the floor, unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Both girls brutally fought with fatal injuries. One trapped in an eternal prison created by her own love, while Jun was trapped in an eternal prison created by Hazel&#39;s love.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quiet hospital room lingered with uncertainty. Hazel slept peacefully, still hurt from the aftermath. Her eyes blinked at the sound of the machinery that surrounded the bed, slowly coming to her senses. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun emerged from her now conscious body, clinging onto her tightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank god&hellip;You&#39;re alright,&rdquo; Jun sighed. A tear fell from Hazel&#39;s eyes, then carefully wrapped her arms around him. She was careful that no one was around, as it would be awkward. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel Hoon,&rdquo; the voice called. The curtain was pulled, then a fresh face appeared behind. &ldquo;You must be the spirit that has been appearing in my dreams&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&hellip;see me?&rdquo; Jun asked. The man placed a hand on his ghost, clearly showing that he could also see him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Elias Novem. If you two would want, I can get you contracts under the International Supernatural Intelligence Division as a force. We&#39;re in constant need of allies as more cosmic disparities take place among Earth,&rdquo; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s more like us?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing like you. What has happened to you is Jun has conjured his soul into your body and your love is able to manifest him as what you see him as,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;Our other units all have unique abilities, similar but not the same to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do remember, the more you enchant yourself, I do have to recharge within your body. My powers aren&#39;t unlimited.&rdquo; Jun explained, kissing her neck. Hazel giggled as she laid back down. Elias had left already to respect their privacy, leaving a contact card on the table beside her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, there were knocks at the door. It was her family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel? Are you alright?&rdquo; her mother cried. She wept out in tears and she hugged her daughter, relieved she was fine. &ldquo;I had thought you died!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her father chuckled as he grinned happily, seeing the change in mood of her daughter. &ldquo;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe and all better,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel joined in on the happiness, comforting her parents, realising the consequences she had to bear with. Her parents threw them off casually, something they wouldn&#39;t normally do and instead blamed themselves. But Hazel knew that was out of their control. It was solely her own fault. But then, Hazel had realised her journey. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t just about reconnecting with Jun&#39;s ghost, nor about winning and beating that scumbag of a doofus into a pulp. For a moment, Hazel cleared her mind, ready to move forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel was glad that her family was here. Hazel had finally understood what it meant to love someone. She understood that people could still live internally even after their physical death, supporting, protecting, guiding and enchanting one to success.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.romf994kyzv5"><span class="c3">A Controlling Confession</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The morning dew drew cold gazes from the neighbouring birds that perched upon the old Tembusu tree. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drip, drop. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel closed her eyes, sitting on the bench in the school yard. The watchful eye gazed upon her, secretly afar. Not a sound was made, all that Hazel could hear was the chilling hums of nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The chirps muffled the menacing sensation that was placed onto Hazel as the target lingered upon her body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel,&rdquo; Jun whispered, stroking her hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel tilted her head back, grinning. &ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Live our lives as normal&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re graduating really soon&hellip;Yet you haven&#39;t decided on anything&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Hazel scoffed. &ldquo;You&#39;re one to say. I learnt a lot after our fight with that bitch Paige that passion can be blinding,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&#39;s an exception!&rdquo; Jun replied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel rolled her eyes, annoyed. &ldquo;Can you stay away today? I need to study for the test.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun sighed, nodding to her request and hiding away back in her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good, stay in there,&rdquo; Hazel muttered, opening her phone. As she walked towards the Art Block, Hazel noticed a student waiting for her, at the building&#39;s door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re Hazel Hoon, right?&rdquo; the boy asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, uh, I&#39;m really sorry about your loss and recent incidents, you just seem really quiet and sad and I was wondering if you were okay,&rdquo; the boy smiled awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel gave him a blank gaze, then chuckled. &ldquo;I&#39;m alright,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re in the same design class so if you need help, you can tell me. My name is Liam by the way.&rdquo; Liam replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel kept her smile as Liam held the door, going into class with a strange sensation. Jun stood quiet within Hazel&#39;s heart, his spirit residing peacefully, attempting to not disturb Hazel&#39;s academic progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel didn&#39;t remember Liam being in her class but at first sight, Liam spoke words to her. Something only Jun had done before to her someone else did. She didn&#39;t question Liam&#39;s history or how he got there, she was intrigued by his identity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His blueberry eyes spoke of gallantry, his chestnut hair radiated charm. There was nothing to not like about Liam, his handsome physique said it all. Not only was it his outer shell, his mannerisms were well-spoken as well, his actions all taken with logic and thought. Just like the new kid Hazel believed he was, he did everything flawlessly and beautifully, every aspect aligning in her vision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel,&rdquo; the teacher snapped. &ldquo;Are you with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Hazel jolted back into reality, her senses settling. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, may I use the bathroom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teacher sighed, and let Hazel wander down the empty hallway. She glared at the notice board, hanging on the gloomy wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Promotional posters for clubs were pinned against the monotone abomination, the words &ldquo;Theatre Club&rdquo; jumped out of the flyer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&#39;t know who&#39;s under the mask!&rdquo; was the quote in serif letters beneath the name, decorated with opera masks. Then, footsteps grew louder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel?&rdquo; her teacher asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y..Yes Mr Lee?&rdquo; Hazel stuttered, surprised he had followed her out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know it has been hard for you lately, but I think what you have been doing, isolating yourself isn&#39;t the right move,&rdquo; Mr Lee explained. Hazel was confused on why Mr Lee was mentioning this, especially at this time. She had friends apart from Jun who were there for her. &ldquo;Perhaps you could socialise with Liam, the new boy. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s kind, and I find him as a quite charming young man,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you telling me this?&rdquo; said Hazel with a disgusted expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel like you&hellip;uh&hellip;just need some help,&rdquo; Mr Lee expressed. As Hazel walked back to the classroom, she witnessed Mr Lee&#39;s movements feel robotic in a way, as if something was controlling him. Hazel threw it off as a figment of her imagination, thinking little of these things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel knew deep inside that she had to talk with Liam. There was just an uneasy gap between the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After class, Liam surprisingly approached Hazel again, and Hazel was again, slightly embarrassed. She grinned awkwardly as she listened to Liam talk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you show me around the school?&rdquo; He asked politely. Of course, Hazel agreed without giving it too much thought, thinking any time would be better than no time around others. She had found being next to people made her feel more comfortable as there were actually people who were willing to help her, though she wasn&#39;t the one actively pursuing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So this is what this school is like?&rdquo; Liam asked as he chewed on the mundane cafeteria lunch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, this is the average high school experience in Singapore,&rdquo; Hazel replied, lost in his sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You seem like a cool guy tho,&rdquo; Hazel added sheepishly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You too, I really like your personality!&rdquo; Liam replied, laughing a bit. Hazel blushed cherry red, trying to cover her embarrassment. Hazel sighed deeply, regaining her composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few more classes, the school day neared the end. As Hazel passed the notice board again, he saw Liam staring at one of the posters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Hazel asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m thinking of joining the theatre club,&rdquo; Liam explained. &ldquo;I quite enjoy acting actually, I took lessons when I was young,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That sounds nice,&rdquo; Hazel replied, smiling. &ldquo;Say, see you tomorrow?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you too!&rdquo; Liam replied as Hazel walked off. Hazel held her head high as she passed the Tembusu tree near the gate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following days after Hazel&#39;s initial greeting with Liam surprisingly went well, with the two spending more time in art class collaborating and communicating. The two developed a close friendship quickly, and Hazel didn&#39;t know what to say about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Deep inside and back home, Jun had raised warnings to Hazel about Liam being suspicious, but Hazel didn&#39;t care too much. Hazel believed that Jun was just jealous how she had made a new male friend that quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So do you have any hobbies?&rdquo; Hazel asked during lunch on a regular school day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been into tattoos and stuff lately,&rdquo; Liam replied, grinning ear to ear. &ldquo;I&#39;ve taught myself how to do tattoo art with a permanent marker at the moment,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Hazel laughed, curious about his technique. &ldquo;Say, you do one for me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She twirled her hair as she smiled back at Liam. Liam smirked. &ldquo;Yeah, follow me after school,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After school, Hazel followed Liam home to see what his art skills were all about. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey uh, just saying, I&#39;m not the best, I can only do this flower if that&#39;s alright,&rdquo; said Liam awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s alright,&rdquo; Hazel replied. In reality, Liam had no idea what he was doing. All he wanted to do was to place his &lsquo;mark&rsquo; on Hazel. It was the start of something more sinister, but it was the only way forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After half an hour of elegant line work, Liam had completed his artwork on Hazel&#39;s right shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow! That looks beautiful! I love it!&rdquo; Hazel exclaimed as she glanced in the mirror. The rose had elegant curves and the use of various width markers gave it depth, making it feel like a real tattoo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following days felt warm and soft with Hazel tracing the petals of her tattoo during class. She&#39;d catch herself staring at the intricate linework on her arm every so often, hiding it away from her parents. It felt like something significant, as if an angel had blessed her. She didn&#39;t dare wash it off, it felt like something precious, something valuable that she would cherish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel didn&#39;t think much of the tattoo at first, but it became evident that it was truly unique as she began to feel a warming sensation throbbing inside her body with the tattoo being the source. The rose tattoo felt alive, with its thorns pointing outwards violently as if it was from a gothic rock band.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not buying it,&rdquo; Jun said quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! You know nothing&hellip;it feels special&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel frowned as she curled up in bed. Jun&#39;s hands wrapped gently around Hazel, comforting her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It feels&hellip;suspicious,&rdquo; Jun claimed, now moving his hands down against her hips. Hazel smiled, nudging Jun against his side. She felt the fingers caress her curves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Days passed, and Liam only grew closer to Hazel, Jun now barely able to spend time with Hazel. It seemed as if Hazel spent most of her time talking and sharing memories with Liam. Part of Jun was happy to see her move out of her comfort zone and gain the ability to move on, but there was a hollow hole left in Jun that made him question if Hazel was doing the right thing. He felt such an evil sensation only growing closer to Hazel, but couldn&#39;t pick out what it exactly was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was one quiet afternoon after school when Hazel had finally had some free time away from Liam. She wanted to check in on Jun for not talking with him for a while. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even late at night when Jun could be with her, he chose not to. Jun believed letting the relationship play out would be the best chain of events to see where everything was truly going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did secretly come out sometimes at midnight, unable to resist the urge to hold Hazel tightly afraid of any danger that would abruptly attack her. There was something sinister lurking beyond the surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel had wandered to the school roof, an area that not many students knew how to get to. It was already 5pm and most students were gone, but Hazel had stayed to enjoy the sunset, hoping to get some time with Jun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the door clicked. The entrance rattled for ages while Hazel tried to piece together who it was. Normally, all students would&#39;ve gone home by now, but the only person Hazel could think of to come here was Liam, even though she had told him explicitly to let her be alone for the afternoon for once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel whispered. No reply. Where had he gone? &ldquo;Jun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s Jun?&rdquo; Liam asked rudely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh um&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel stuttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Actually, I don&#39;t need to know. I </span><span class="c9">already</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;know. It&#39;s your boyfriend, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo; Liam snickered. His voice grew dark, his pace quickened. &ldquo;Too bad you couldn&#39;t see through my guise,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hazel panicked. Liam&#39;s body began to float and Hazel&#39;s heart sank into the abyssal void Jun had drowned in, unable to move. She was paralyzed in fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Liam&#39;s face ripped into a lustrous and petite young girl, her hair flowing like the river caressed in crimson stripes. Her beauty slashed the exterior masculine body, revealing her ultimate form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;ve caused enough trouble in our universe&hellip;I can feel it tearing! For the Lord of Wisdom, Lucina rises!&rdquo; Lucina yelled. Hazel tried to scramble, but the tattoo she had gotten jolted her body back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t move!&rdquo; Hazel squealed, squirming with all her might. Her body felt like it was controlled like a puppet, a force tugging her legs backward. &ldquo;I&#39;m being controlled!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! Stay still!&rdquo; Lucina ordered, forcing Hazel to slap herself on the face. Hazel gazed at the tattoo again, only to realise it wasn&#39;t a tattoo. It was a mark, a symbol of control. She was the puppet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; Hazel begged, her eyes tearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to hear your shrill voice, piercing that of the silence!&rdquo; Lucina laughed. &ldquo;I want to hear that squeal, that scream, that moan of terror!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmph!&rdquo; Hazel grunted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are breaking the Jespan&#39;s dream apart&hellip;If you live, the universe collapses&hellip;Your ghost of a boyfriend has caused this cosmic disparity!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s hands gripped onto her own soft neck, her fingers pressing hard on her smooth skin. She whimpered weakly as she struggled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Hazel choked, her vision getting thinner. Lucina pushed Hazel against the wall, feeling her pulsing heartbeat. Hazel felt her body skip a beat, sinking into something warm. Lucina grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina thrusted her fist towards Hazel, but to her surprise Hazel counterattacked by attempting to throw a kick. Lucina dodged easily, pushing Hazel back down again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;P&hellip;Please&hellip;S&hellip;Stop&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel gurgled. White foam frothed from her mouth, now on the brink of death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile the battle was raging outside, the tattoo&#39;s marks had infested the interior of Hazel&#39;s soul, plaguing every last patch with the poisonous thorns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun wandered carefully, attempting to pluck away the sharp, veiny roots the rose had implanted in her body. His pale hands brushed the rigid green stems, trying to move among the thick labyrinth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These roots had been growing ever since the mark had been implanted on Hazel, and Jun struggled to come out. The physical mark had left a permanent scar both physically and mentally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They wouldn&#39;t budge, especially to those ghostly hands Jun had. He couldn&#39;t interact or do anything to save Hazel. But he believed. As Hazel struggled, the roots crawled further back, slowly retracting as life faded out of her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodbye. It was fun while it lasted,&rdquo; Lucina scoffed, smiling as she turned her back on Hazel&#39;s dead body. It had flopped to the ground like an askew statue. Her body reeked a faint glow, frozen, but still somehow alive. Lucina ignored it, believing she was already dead. The mark faded away and Jun was free again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel&hellip;This is my remaining power! Let your body be my host for one last dance!&rdquo; Jun erupted, his voice reaching Lucina. Hazel&#39;s eyes began glowing a shimmering golden yellow, her body floating in the hair as if she was being crucified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;More ghostly magic?&rdquo; Lucina spat, twitching at the sight of her power carrying on even after her death. &ldquo;How will I remove you now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina concentrated a dense ball of energy, flinging it towards Hazel. It hit her chest hard, leaving another mark. The flower&#39;s roots rushed into her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Hazel&#39;s body streaked forward, plunging directly towards Lucina like a bullet. Lucina&#39;s expression widened at the speed at which Hazel&#39;s body flew over, knocking her hard into the building&#39;s wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Lucina grumbled, crawling out under the crumbled debris of the wall. Hazel&#39;s body rose through the mess and was covered in blood, but still looked menacingly stronger than before. Lucina gasped in shock for the first time in many centuries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun, now in somewhat control of Hazel&#39;s body again lunged towards Lucina, aiming to wound her severely. Hazel&#39;s fist was concentrated with energy, love pulsing every beat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha-at? No-o-o! This can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Lucina squelched. Blood spattered forward, her logic muddled. Jun had torn a deep, hollow hole in Lucina&#39;s body, rendering her almost dead immediately. She attempted to control Hazel&#39;s body again, but it was no use. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know your weakness. You can only control living organisms with that mark of yours&hellip;Sucks to say I can possess anything since I&#39;m a ghost manifested from love!&rdquo; Jun snickered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun&#39;s fist tore out of Lucina&#39;s wound, completely free of her control. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina motioned for aid, unable to regain full control of Hazel&#39;s body. It was in possession of love itself, it was in possession of Jun. &ldquo;As her life fades away, I will join her. That is what love is&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The faded white silhouette of Jun masked the geometric shapes that blurred Lucina&#39;s vision, seeing her last moments as a Jespan Lord. How could she, of all, be defeated by mere humans? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina wept as a hollow, donut wound ate her body. She bled out slowly, laying hopeless on the roof. The clouds fluffed up as she gazed up, only to see formations of those she battled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A pool of venom green blood was splattered against the concrete floor, emitting a foul stench that dissipated in the air. Lucina tried to crawl with her last breath, hoping her allies would assist her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s body toppled over, landing beside Lucina. There was silence for a moment before the breathless sound of sprinting was heard coming from the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Hazel and Jun, all they could see was their love. Bound by something extraordinary named the power of love burned Lucina&#39;s preliminary notion of wisdom and knowledge, savouring her death for the shimmering sunset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t die like this&hellip;&rdquo; Lucina gasped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Die like what?&rdquo; a voice emerged, tired and huffing. The black vests adorned with magenta streaks of the officials of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division appeared, with the notorious face of their leader leaning down towards her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sucks to be a Jespan Lord, heh?&rdquo; Elias chuckled, floating down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you! It can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Lucina gasped. Over the following days, Lucina died with her body being cremated, attempting to restore some cosmic balance. The ISID had presumed this technique would greatly help, patching any cosmic disparities that may have laid around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina&#39;s body drifted away along with the breeze, the ash scattering among the ground like autumn leaves. There was flow back into the world, but Elias knew that this was the beginning of something far more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Jespan Lords had begun their pursuit. He didn&#39;t know much, but all Elias could think of then was about Hazel. She had sacrificed her life to take down one of the most powerful supernatural beings alive.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.i04j9mnxwx07"><span class="c3">As the Void Gently Weeps</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good afternoon Singapore, we bring to you the latest news. The International Supernatural Intelligence Division is currently investigating a series of electromagnetic anomalies. We urge the public to stay safe as these are complex cases that deserve careful, scientific inquiry.&rdquo; the TV blared. The waiting room was quiet and Milo said patiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo Trueno,&rdquo; the receptionist called. Milo entered the room, not expecting much. The intimidating sign; International Supernatural Intelligence Division loomed above the counter as he approached the friendly woman who sat idly at the desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi?&rdquo; Milo greeted awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here for the test funding I presume?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. How much am I getting paid?&rdquo; Milo asked nervously, crossing his fingers behind his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;$1,000. If the tests go well, you could work here,&rdquo; the receptionist reassured. &ldquo;Third room on your left,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo walked down the hallway to the room the receptionist had asked him to go to. As he pressed upon the large blue doors with the label &ldquo;Testing Chamber&rdquo;, butterflies flooded his stomach. He had never felt this much pressure, but it meant that he could finally live a proper life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo Trueno I presume?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, here for testing,&rdquo; Milo replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, my name is Dr. Lim, I just need you to hold this crystal,&rdquo; Dr Lim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Milo asked curiously, his fingers tracing the flat edges of the crystal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an orichalcum crystal. It&rsquo;s supposed to be an abundant mountain mineral, but they happen to conduct cosmic energy extremely well, awakening secret powers within the universe,&rdquo; Dr. Lim explained. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t hurt a bit, but it will feel ticklish,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Lim approached the silver button mounted on the wall, activating the mechanism that directed cosmic energy into the crystal. &ldquo;Stay VERY still!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he pressed the button, a short, faint purple wave traversed the room, locating the crystal to which it transferred into. As the crystal became the new host of the cosmic energy, Dr. Lim moved to a different room beside Milo, ready to execute the final step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you see that plate? Place the orichalcum on it and press the red button,&rdquo; Dr. Lim instructed. Milo followed his instructions and a strong, deafening force engulfed the room, knocking Milo over onto the soft padded floors. The room was designed extremely well for human testing and Milo didn&rsquo;t get injured, only confused and a bit sleepy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Lim quickly rushed back into the room, comforting Milo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright? Did it work?&rdquo; Dr. Lim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Milo replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, the testing normally only succeeds 7% of the time. Let me know if you find anything soon. It can take up to 24 hours for abilities to form within the human body,&rdquo; Dr. Lim smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be successful. Patience is a virtue afterall,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo walked out back to the receptionist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did everything go?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I don&rsquo;t know-&rdquo; Milo began. However, his words cut short. His body sparked and leapt into the computer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; the receptionist smiled. She picked up the phone and dialled in her supervisor. &ldquo;Director Ozim, I think we got a new agent!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The meeting room was vibrant, in fact lively as Milo would describe. Milo had found his new abilities and was eager to finally make some money. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Milo Trueno, what should I call you? You&rsquo;ve got supernatural abilities, so it&rsquo;s normal to have a code name,&rdquo; Ozim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Code name? Like a superhero?&rdquo; Milo asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, exactly. I&rsquo;ve seen your power as my employee has described,&rdquo; Ozim began. &ldquo;Conducting and insulating electricity&hellip;Turning into living electricity&hellip;Frightening&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How about Malstrom?&rdquo; Milo suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Yes! That sounds slick, suitable for you. Also, you said you are having financial difficulties, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo nodded in eagerness. &ldquo;Yes, my parents both have stage 4 cancer&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to lose them&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry. I&rsquo;ll give you a job, if you can complete it, I&rsquo;ll wire you anything you need. Whether it be money, I&rsquo;ll make sure your life is turned around,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you so much sir&hellip;&rdquo; Milo gasped, his heart racing. For once, he was finally able to make a name for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s your job rundown,&rdquo; Ozim began. He pulled out his phone and showed a headline: &ldquo;Sudden Radiation Surge at Train Station Hospitalises Seven&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He zoomed in on the CCTV footage embedded in the article. Star was in the background walking past a steel pole, eyes low.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Three of those people developed aggressive tumours a week later. The others are blind now,&rdquo; Ozim said grimly. &ldquo;We traced the radiation burst. It wasn&rsquo;t from any machine. It came from someone&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not possible&hellip;&rdquo; Milo murmured. &ldquo;Radiation can&rsquo;t just come from a human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unless that human was made into something else,&rdquo; Ozim replied, voice cold. &ldquo;Look through this gallery, every unexplained EM anomaly in the last month, every spike in gamma signatures, Star was there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s just a nerd from my English class,&rdquo; Milo protested weakly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quiet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even </span><span class="c9">realise</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;what he is,&rdquo; Ozim said. &ldquo;That&#39;s what makes him dangerous. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. But people keep dying around him. And no one will believe it until it&#39;s too late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Wait, are you suggesting the cancer my parents mysteriously got could be by </span><span class="c9">him</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; Milo realised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Potentially, but it&rsquo;s not certain. You&rsquo;ll have to ask him yourself,&rdquo; Ozim explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll get this job done, Director Ozim. I won&rsquo;t let you down,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Milo, this </span><span class="c9">isn&#39;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an execution. We need you to bring him here. As long as he is not dead, we&#39;re good. We cannot be letting him hurt any more innocent lives,&rdquo; Ozim restated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Milo left his office, he passed the receptionist again. Her smile radiated in the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo, I won&rsquo;t lie to you. What we&rsquo;re asking is hard. We&#39;re here to help anytime,&rdquo; the receptionist exclaimed. Miles paused and nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the autumn leaves swept beneath Star&#39;s feet, a black cat jumped across the street. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Meow!&rdquo; The cat hastily made its way to the shop&#39;s entrance, where Star had lived. Star&#39;s family wasn&#39;t the richest and had owned a measly restaurant that barely earned enough profit to keep them fed and sheltered. Still, Star&#39;s enthusiasm sparked in his unconventional silver hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star was born with Albinism, a rare condition that made his skin and hair lighter. Not only did his silver hair spark at school, his light grey eyes were scary for some. But overall, his outward appearance had visual harmony and attracted girls easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was evident to say Star was quite popular at school. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you see the news?&rdquo; students exclaimed through the hallways. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel is dead somehow and Liam has gone missing!&rdquo; others shouted. The school was in a craze after 3 incidents had occurred. Nobody felt safe and everyone thought they were next on a murderer&#39;s list of some sort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star didn&#39;t care. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Ace,&rdquo; Erik nudged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Star replied. &ldquo;What do you want this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You gonna figure out the meaning behind the murder?&rdquo; Erik asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you come to me? Like I said, I don&#39;t want to be dragged into any drama!&rdquo; Star sighed, slamming his locker shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you&#39;re Ace! You&#39;re known for your insane smarts, please broski!&rdquo; Erik pleaded, clutching on his shirt. Start pushed him back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back off, I already said no. Do your own hero antics,&rdquo; Star scoffed, slinging his backpack on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Erik groaned. &ldquo;Come to my party tonight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star ignored Erik&rsquo;s offer and shook his head in frustration. Suddenly, Star saw the same black cat again. It crossed the street softly this time, each step treading with care. It didn&#39;t get hit by a car, and it ran towards Star for a strange reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Star asked, petting the cute cat. It purred and rubbed itself against Star&#39;s leg. Students walked towards Star as if he was the centre of attention, watching him play with the cat. Star had never liked attention, and he didn&rsquo;t know if it was because of the way he interacted with the cat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cat hissed. Star nervously clutched the cat in his hands and walked home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma! I&#39;m home!&rdquo; Star yelled as he placed the cat outside the store. Again, the seats were empty as he walked inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&#39;s the cat from yesterday!&rdquo; his mother replied. &ldquo;How was school?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Star replied. His mother grabbed a bowl and poured a little milk and placed it on the floor to which the cat happily ran over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why don&#39;t you keep the cat? It certainly thinks our store is nice and cozy,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what if it is someone else&#39;s?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on Star, you barely have any friends,&rdquo; his mother scolded. &ldquo;We&#39;ve given you academic goals and you have always crushed them, but apart from that, you&#39;ve done nothing your entire life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the cat sneezed. Star unfortunately caught a whiff and immediately turned around, somewhat disgusted. His mother laughed but Star wasn&#39;t amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&#39;mon, stop pushing yourself!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star rolled his eyes as he plopped down his lunch box on the kitchen counter, then walked away into the shadows of his bedroom. He never looked back, Star only ever had one goal in mind. Be the star of the school that aced every test. He didn&#39;t care about what others thought, but it was a clear goal. Heck, he didn&#39;t even know what he was going to pursue after his final year of school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His slow trance towards his room was sluggish compared to the cat&#39;s speed, for it stealthily bolted into the darkness of Star&#39;s room first, pouncing onto his chair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; Star asked, flicking the lights on. He lazily threw his bag down in the corner of his room and got his workbook out with a scrumpled worksheet underneath it. It was extra exercise for math that he had gotten from his teacher. &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cat instead leapt for his bed, swiftly executing a marvelous landing on his soft pillow. Its claws didn&#39;t claw against any of the bedding, and Star was impressed for once. The light bulb suddenly flickered on and off, a strange phenomenon that caught Star&rsquo;s eye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom, the light is broken again!&rdquo; Star yelled down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; his mother sighed. &ldquo;I wish your father was still around&hellip;He&rsquo;d know how to fix these things better than me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; Star smiled. He petted the cat gently as he watched his mother help fix the light. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;I heard one of your classmates is celebrating something tonight, word from our group chat says it&rsquo;s a big party, are you going to go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Party? Not my thing mom,&rdquo; Star replied, falling flat on his bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you need to go out more! At least go exercise by walking there. If you don&rsquo;t like it, come home, alright?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine&hellip;&rdquo; Star rolled his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cold night breeze was rather chilling, for the temperature had dropped down to a whopping 5 degrees celsius. For an Autumn night, it was quite rare. As Star walked along the footpath to Erik&rsquo;s house, he saw a man sitting on the sidewalk, covered in rugged sheets and a hood. It masked his face and he couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like for a homeless guy like him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it also hit Star in the head. Why was a homeless guy in a suburban area?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Star asked as he approached the man. &ldquo;Are you cold? Why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Read the sign,&rdquo; the man grunted, half asleep. The sign read; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m immortal, kill me now.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Immortal?&rdquo; Star chuckled. &ldquo;As if! Magic doesn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man sighed. He gently touched a flower beside him and it crumbled instantly, then the ash remnants were swept by the breeze. Star was shocked. Suddenly, the man looked up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t felt this presence in so long&hellip;&rdquo; the man blurted, slowly standing up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, what are you doing?&rdquo; Star asked. &ldquo;Who are you, and why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, you might be my saving grace. Are you busy at all?&rdquo; the man asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Well, not really,&rdquo; Star replied, smiling awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, follow me,&rdquo; the man motioned, leading Star away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Sadana&hellip;It might sound ridiculous, but I am no human. I&rsquo;m known to be a Jespan Lord&hellip;&rdquo; Sadana began as they walked through the neighbourhood. It felt magical to Star since he couldn&rsquo;t believe that instead of going to a party, he was talking to a presumed alien that needed his help to be killed. &ldquo;Like you saw what I did to the flower, I am the depiction of decay and death. I can make physical objects undergo rapid decay which turns them into nothing or dust,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their conversation continued, and Star had followed Sadana to a nearby scrapyard. The monotone landscape spoke of melancholy as Sadana sat down on the hood of a car, sighing. &ldquo;Well, show me your powers kid,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Powers? I don&rsquo;t have any, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;&rdquo; Star replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Focus. Concentrate.&rdquo; Sadana instructed. The dim overhead lights casted subtle shadows that Star began absorbing. &ldquo;Facsinating&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a cosmic being like Sadana, he could see things Star couldn&rsquo;t. It was the energy that came from the lights overhead, and Sadana observed Star&rsquo;s body reacting to this light energy being directed to him. He absorbed it like fuel, charging something up internally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Try to shoot that car headlight over there,&rdquo; Sadana directed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How do I do that?&rdquo; Star asked. Sadana lazily hopped off the hood of the car and helped Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You aim and channel your inner energy,&rdquo; Sadana guided. Star&rsquo;s eyes began to glow a whitish yellow, and then all of a sudden, a concentrated beam of light shot out, destroying the car headlight instantly. It was surreal to see such magical things happen to Star&rsquo;s body, and he wondered where and when he had gotten this power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah&hellip;&rdquo; Star gasped. &ldquo;I had this power in me all the time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure, kid. I see potential in you,&rdquo; Sadana smiled. &ldquo;Come here tomorrow sometime, I&rsquo;ll teach you more. I&rsquo;m sure you humans need to sleep or something,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Star smiled. &ldquo;You alone here, or what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe so. I&rsquo;m alone, disconnected and lonely. I&rsquo;ve got nothing left and worth fighting for so I might as well spend my time teaching you younglings. A new generation of power is vital,&rdquo; Sadana smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wanna be friends? You seem nice, plus, people like us need someone to rely on,&rdquo; Star suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;d love to! &lsquo;Til dust do us apart!&rdquo; Sadana exclaimed, waving Star off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day at school, Star took a different approach. He figured that his powers had something to do with light energy, and he presumed he could store that energy somehow. From his studies, he concluded the electromagnetic spectrum had to be related somehow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryan just got cancer!&rdquo; students in the hallway chattered. &ldquo;Did you know Harry got sunburnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;In Autumn? That&#39;s nonsense!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo got the intercom working again and helped fix all the computers this morning&hellip;&rdquo; more students added. &ldquo;They&#39;ve been bugged all week! I can finally finish my research paper!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star ignored the small talk. Whatever the students were gossiping about, Star just couldn&#39;t unhear it. Cancer? Sunburns? Was it himself causing these phenomenons? He concluded that it could be since his powers drew directly from light, and it could cause burns. UV could cause cancer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Star was walking home again, the black cat remerged. Did it come out of his bedroom again? It was almost like the cat had followed him everyday. Then, he felt it. An ultraviolet wave had just reflected off of his face into a concentrated amount, directed right towards the school principal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star&#39;s eyes widened and took a quick glance but quickly darted back to not draw attention. He knew this was bad. The principal getting cancer? Every sign led to him. He was scared to reveal his power as he knew he was a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sadana, I still can&#39;t control my powers&hellip;I&#39;ve learnt what my abilities do, but I can&#39;t seem to restrict it!&rdquo; Star sighed. He etched sketches into the pebbled sand with a steel rod, providing Sadana company in the scrapyard. It was peaceful and a distant place where Star found to connect with deeply, somewhere he began to feel safe. &ldquo;I&#39;m just like you&hellip;how you told me you lost everyone you loved&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&#39;s not about the things you can destroy, it&#39;s about the things you can protect. Unlike me, all I could do was destroy. I didn&#39;t protect anyone,&rdquo; Sadana replied. His advice was quite grim but surprisingly, Star understood what he meant. He was different. He had the chance to prove to everyone he wasn&#39;t a mindless killer. &ldquo;Your powers are different than mine, kid,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell that to my classmate. All of a sudden, he&#39;s the talk of the town,&rdquo; Star began. &ldquo;Fixing a load of electronical devices at school, he&#39;s gained a reputation of hardware guy! I used to be the one everyone relied on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana was blank. Nothing clicked. Silence took over the conversation for a minute until Sadana breathed heavily through his nose, letting out a deep exhale. &ldquo;There&#39;s no point in comparing yourself with others if you&#39;re supposed to be competing with yourself,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Star asked angrily. &ldquo;Stop speaking in riddles all the time!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He needed to let off some steam. Sadana sighed yet again and laid down on the scrap metallic sheets. He watched Star destroy and create chaos in the scrapyard. It was the only space he felt free to use his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Director Ozim, I will be commencing my capture of Star very soon,&rdquo; Milo reported, handing an extensive research paper to him. Milo had worked on this project for the past few days without Star noticing him. Though Milo was heavily behind on schoolwork, he was determined to put an end to Star&#39;s massacre.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Thanks for giving me some extra information, this will help a lot,&rdquo; Ozim replied, scanning the document. As he read the document, he realised the ugly truth. &ldquo;This proves my theory. Star has killed these innocents. Over 100. But he doesn&#39;t know his power. This is </span><span class="c9">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s also got a mentor of some sort&hellip;His name was Sadana?&rdquo; Milo added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sadana? The Jespan Lord of Decay? That&#39;s terrible! I will send my best agents as soon as I can. Don&#39;t rush in! I repeat, do not rush in! Do NOT engage in the fight!&rdquo; Ozim ordered. Sadana was one of the most powerful Jespan Lords and the ISID had merely prepared for this. Was this fate&#39;s doing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I got you. When do I go in?&rdquo; Milo asked. He was prepared. Just like Star had a mentor, Ozim had personally trained Milo to become a stronger agent, teaching him how to maximise his abilities. He felt confident he could beat Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This weekend. Though all my agents are all busy on a separate mission, you must not fail. You want to save lives correct?&rdquo; Ozim asked. Milo&#39;s conviction to save lives was held in high regard and was indomitable. His will, his goal was almost complete. He nodded in utter truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will not fail you Director Ozim!&rdquo; said Milo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The timing couldn&#39;t get any better as it was the weekend, a Sunday morning when Milo flew out of the training facility Ozim had helped construct for him. It was finally time to capture the killer. As he traversed the electrical currents to his house, Milo thought about the lives he could save. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, Milo knew he couldn&#39;t attack Star head on. He knew his own weaknesses, and knew he would get obliterated easily by Star&#39;s power. He had to get him somewhere dark, and to drain his energy out, so he waited for the perfect time to strike. Milo sneakily watched every move Star performed, following him to the scrapyard in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Sadana!&rdquo; Star greeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you supposed to be followed?&rdquo; Sadana asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Star replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who is that?&rdquo; Sadana pointed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dang! That old dude saw me!&rdquo; Malstrom thought. He had no choice but to reveal himself. He took a deep breath and expected the worst. As he popped his head up, he saw Star and Sadana staring at him expressionless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me, Star?&rdquo; Malstrom asked. &ldquo;I&#39;m in your English class!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&hellip;are you?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Milo!&rdquo; Malstrom cackled. &ldquo;You&hellip;You&rsquo;ve ruined so many lives&hellip;And I will finally put an end to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me&hellip;?&rdquo; Star asked. &ldquo;What do I have to do with their deaths?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Malstrom unfolded a piece of paper from his pocket and held it against Star&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Look at what you&rsquo;ve done! You killed this girl! Your power of light&hellip;It&rsquo;s killing people!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The image was the same image Director Ozim had shown him. The girl with sunburns and the three men diagnosed with cancer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Star yelled, trying to rip it up. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise my powers back then, plus, I didn&rsquo;t have control!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get these powers anyway? Are you getting paid to do this?&rdquo; Star scowled, hurling himself towards Malstrom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Malstrom grunted, pushing Star back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You cannot change the past, Milo! There&rsquo;s no point saving your parents, you have to let it go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! Don&rsquo;t talk about my parents!&rdquo; Malstrom roared. His body&rsquo;s voltage rose, the electric energy within himself grew stronger. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drag them into this mess! I&rsquo;m only trying to save lives!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, but that means I&rsquo;ll be kicking your ass!&rdquo; Star growled, lunging forward at the speed of light. His movements outpaced Malstrom&rsquo;s significantly, beating him easily to a pulp. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Malstrom yelled, running towards a nearby warehouse. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Find me!&rdquo; Star laughed, becoming invisible by absorbing the ultraviolet light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing your games!&rdquo; Malstrom exclaimed, running into the warehouse. Star and Sadana quickly followed, pursuing Malstrom closely. As they entered, the door bolted shut with an electrical locking system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What happened?!&rdquo; Sadana yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Star exclaimed, terrified. The window shutters rolled down suddenly, sending a thunderous clatter that echoed in the warehouse. No light leaked in. It was pure darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star&hellip;I know your weakness! No light, no might! I&rsquo;ve rigged the electrical system so that there&rsquo;s no light!&rdquo; Malstrom laughed. Star was frustrated that Malstrom had known his weakness already, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up. He focused his stored energy, allowing his body to emit a dim light that illuminated a small area around him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There, Star saw the enormous warehouse, with shipping containers piled along the walls. Sadana stood motionless next to Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Sadana commanded, instructing him to take the fight himself. He trusted Star, for he had grown significantly since they first met. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you lifeless!&rdquo; Malstrom yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure you meet your parents!&rdquo; Star exclaimed. &ldquo;I bet they would never imagine their son going down this path! They&rsquo;d be better off dead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The words hit Milo hard. Again? His parents? He hated people talking about them. He loved his family, and he didn&rsquo;t want them to die for anything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just a few more years&hellip;&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gonna be alright,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Milo was going to fight, it was going to be for his parents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arghh!&rdquo; Milo launched. The two traded blows at each other, dealing significant damage to the surrounding environment. Milo was careful not to destroy the warehouse too much, otherwise the sunlight would boost Star&rsquo;s power significantly. He also had to defend against Star punching or melting out a hole for sunlight to leak in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo landed a direct hit, an electrical surge that tasered Star for a second, paralysing him. In that moment, Milo lunged in and struck Star down, hard into the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;out&hellip;&rdquo; Star huffed as he tumbled to the ground. He was exhausted, and it felt over. The warehouse was still dark and no light could enter. Star was powerless. He had run out of fuel. His heart paced faster, wiping the blood from his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Out of juice, light boy?&rdquo; Malstrom sniggered as he jumped into the electrical system to recharge his own power. His laugh sounded like a fluctuating electric voltage, sending a chilling sensation down his spine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana looked in disbelief, but knew Star still had the strength and most importantly, the courage to continue fighting. However, Sadana still sighed and decided to give Star just a small glint of hope. He unwillingly swiped at the electric box near the entrance, causing it to disintegrate and reveal the wiring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your moves are too slow, old man!&rdquo; Malstrom laughed, leaping out of a wire and attempting to drag Sadana in with him. His electrical form ignored Sadana&rsquo;s abilities, allowing him to firmly grip his body. &ldquo;I know your limits! The ISID has documented your powers already! Your decaying touch can&rsquo;t chain, it only affects singular materials!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who says I was trying to destroy the warehouse? That&rsquo;s not necessary for victory,&rdquo; Sadana grinned. &ldquo;Brain beats the brawl, that&rsquo;s what Lucina had always said,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up old man!&rdquo; Malstrom spat, ignoring his lecture. He didn&rsquo;t believe Star could win. Malstrom smirked at the exposed wires leading underground now that the box was gone, able to see where he was going. He had devised a plan at that moment, almost executing it instantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the underworld!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ace!&rdquo; Sadana cried as his fingers barely grazed the door. The door began breaking down, leaving nothing but a frame that exposed the sun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You little!&rdquo; Malstrom roared. His eyes darted around to look for Star, but he was gone. How did he disappear all of a sudden? Unable to react, Malstrom noticed the wire had been broken. He had been forced out, and his grip was still firmly attached to Sadana. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ultraviolet waves are invisible-&rdquo; Star began. &ldquo;I reflected a concentration of UV to burn the wires&hellip;Wither away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Malstrom finally flew out of the wire, revealing his true, vulnerable human form. A frail looking boy, still holding onto Sadana, was terrified. He forcefully pushed Malstrom away, not wanting to speed up his gradual death. Afterall, he didn&rsquo;t want to fight. It was Star&rsquo;s battle in the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; Malstrom cried. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how those murders happened&hellip;&rdquo; Star explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, I just didn&rsquo;t have it controlled until recently&hellip;And I&rsquo;m sorry about your parents, I don&rsquo;t even know if I did it to them,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Malstrom wailed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The whole school knows! We all care, but you can&rsquo;t do much! You have to move on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana was silent. Milo had begun fading. He had killed another. Of course, he felt guilty as he had ended countless lives before with his touch. Innocent lives, gone with a singular touch. Loved ones, withered away with a singular touch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star sighed. He leant down and placed his hand on Milo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m open to change, willing to help. But whatever you&rsquo;ve done, you&rsquo;ve made yourself worse,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Milo had faded. His body was gone, decayed into nothing but a pile of ash. Star&rsquo;s heartbeat spiked, staring at the remains of Milo. Sadana quietly stood up and walked to the docks. It was quiet again, and the waves crashed against the rocks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I need to retire. I must find a way to depart from this world&hellip;&rdquo; Sadana began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived for already 2000 years, and I don&rsquo;t think my existence will help humanity in any way,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you can&#39;t leave!&rdquo; Star shouted, reaching out. &ldquo;You still have a lot to teach me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It hurts for me as well, Ace,&rdquo; Sadana cried. A tear trickled down his face that hung a heavy frown. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to live forever,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What am I supposed to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, live. Unlike me, enjoy life for what it is,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you&#39;re&hellip;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Continue to transcend humanity&hellip;Your strength&hellip;It excels far beyond my own&hellip;I sense that I&rsquo;ve met something like you&hellip;2000 years ago&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the sun set, Sadana&#39;s words pierced deep into Star&#39;s heart. He held it firmly, unable to control his emotions. His body bathed beneath the ultraviolet rays of the stars that rose just up ahead. Star gazed up hazily, blinded by his own power. His cold, alien-like hand pressed gently on Star&rsquo;s chest as the sunlight reflected off his face. The decay had begun. &ldquo;Do you understand now, boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana&rsquo;s body had begun to wither, his own ability of gamma decay had reflected off of Star. Star hung his head low, unable to face the truth, the harsh truth that stood in front of him. Losing his teacher? No, it was more than that. Losing his only friend, it was. He wasn&rsquo;t a hero. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My powers&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finally controlled them. It&rsquo;s not about why you fight, it&rsquo;s about why you live.&rdquo; Sadana whimpered. &ldquo;Go on, prove to the world that Ace isn&rsquo;t a brutal killing machine&hellip;show your good,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last thing Star witnessed was Sadana&rsquo;s faint and weak smile. It pained Star so hard internally that he didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to say goodbye. Sadana&rsquo;s decaying body slowly trickled into a fine powder, forming a neat pile on the concrete floor. The breeze carried the dust of his body as he disintegrated, leaving Star gazing at the open sea. He was alone, with overflowing gamma. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Sadana&hellip;I will make you proud!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, the black cat appeared again. It had magically teleported to the port&#39;s edge. It purred gently, then a sickening meow followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star wailed in pain, so he flew into the sunset at the speed of light, needing to release some steam in his body. The cat waited on the port, waiting for Star to come back. As the night grew colder, Star didn&rsquo;t stop. He didn&rsquo;t want to go back. He couldn&rsquo;t go back. It was stopping him.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.aez6ib2zs0fz"><span class="c3">The Sky that Calls</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unidentified object entering our airspace!&rdquo; the commander shouted. The control panel had gone mayday when the object had flown into Taiwan airspace. &ldquo;It&#39;s moving so fast! Ready weapons!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soldiers rushed up to the front line ready to shoot down the unidentified flying object, but it was no use. It flew at the speed of light, circling the southern shore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;What is that </span><span class="c9">thing</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; the commander yelled. &ldquo;Skye! I need an answer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Skye Sun was the renowned scientist who had worked under the Taiwanese military, aiding them in scientific and technological advancement. Though he was familiar with such speeds, he trembled in fear. Skye hesitated for a moment, then came to a sudden realisation. &ldquo;That&#39;s no object commander, </span><span class="c9">that&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;my son,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?

It&#39;s the orange serum that we have now&hellip;&rdquo; Skye explained. &ldquo;At first, I believed it could heal my sun due to the high amount of stem-cell-like regenerative proteins. It did, but it came with side effects such as turning his hair white and eyes silver,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Continue&hellip;&rdquo; the commander stroked his beard, curious about Skye&#39;s relationship with this serum. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, after a year, we began noticing strange incidents happening whenever my child was around. He&#39;s a weapon of mass destruction,&rdquo; Skye concluded. &ldquo;He is almost like an alien now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Precisely. An Avidrene to be specific,&rdquo; a voice rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;General Colerico!&rdquo; the commander greeted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Skye Sun, your son is special. If we&#39;re able to neutralise and control him, we can take down the manipulative and corrupt International Supernatural Intelligence Division. That Jaxton Ozim&hellip;&rdquo; General Colerico exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well Colerico, we&#39;ll be happy to assist. I&#39;m so glad your company Anateros agreed to help strengthen our army. We couldn&#39;t thank you any more for all the firearms and funds you&#39;ve donated to us,&rdquo; the commander thanked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No worries kiddo, we all need a little help,&rdquo; General Colerico smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Colerico! I&#39;ve gotten updates on the lifeform you asked. Look at this development!&rdquo; Skye exclaimed, switching tabs to a monitor that displayed a black goo that formed the shape of a puddle contained in a small box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that&#39;s an Avidrene&hellip;&rdquo; the commander inspected. He stroked his spiky beard as he watched the slop of black jump around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been monitoring it for a while. It can take the form of anything as long as it has enough mass&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;and the serum?&rdquo; General Colerico questioned, smirking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s the Avidrenes&rsquo; blood. It can awaken powers seen in my son,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great to hear the research is coming along. I&#39;ll be presenting to African countries soon about this plan, helping them thrive with a supernatural being. Their abilities and support could greatly benefit them!&rdquo; General Colerico reinforced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What should we do about him sir?&rdquo; the commander asked again, leaning towards the microphone. The lights on the control panels were still blaring a loud alarm that pulsed a red light. The commander quickly switched the alarm off and fiddled with the controls. Barton swung on his thick coat, decorated with Anateros&rsquo; white and green logo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, leave Star to me,&rdquo; General Colerico explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring your son down for a long overdue reunion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Star soared across the skyline, Colerico pulled out a mirror. It reflected the pale, orange rays of the sun that alerted Star. Slowly, he approached the hillside where Barton Colerico stood firm, confronting Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star Sun?&rdquo; Barton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this light about?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, to get your attention. Your father is with us. I know it&rsquo;s a surprise to know that he&rsquo;s alive, but he&rsquo;s trying his best. I know you miss him, so why not come in for a reunion?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My&hellip;my father?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next thing Star knew was that he was in a futuristic lab of some sort with big, italicised sans serif letters that spelt out &lsquo;Anateros&rsquo;. The walls were slick adorned with geometric shapes with huge amounts of reinforced glass to allow for easy inspection. There were various advanced machinery present, and an armory full of powerful equipment for military use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Taiwan&rsquo;s a country in need of freedom. Chained down by the powerful CCP, we&rsquo;ve been helping them to fight back against the powerhouse the mainland has,&rdquo; Barton described. &ldquo;Anateros is an ambitious company. We always try our best for the freedom and betterment of all people. No one should be in chained down like this,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star resonated with the company&rsquo;s message heavily. Fighting for the betterment of everyone? Yes please! His own interpretation of the company made him believe they not only helped countries, but also people to become better. He leant on the notion that the company underscored the value of teaching younger teenagers like him on how to navigate the corrupt world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We do what the world won&rsquo;t. We arm the helpless. We teach the forgotten. Yes, it&rsquo;s messy, but hope has always been forged in fire.&rdquo; Barton reiterated. He stood proud in emphasising the company&rsquo;s message, believing Star had complete trust in him and his colleagues. As Star walked past large vials containing black serum like liquid, a strange sensation crept down his spine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; Barton guided. &ldquo;Skye! Your son is here,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad&hellip;?&rdquo; Star whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star? Is that really you?&rdquo; Skye asked, his voice quivering in excitement. The two shared a long lasting hug that felt like an eternity until Star pushed back with a nervous and grim expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you leave me&hellip;?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for never telling you son&hellip;&rdquo; Skye began. &ldquo;I truly apologise. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything from the beginning tomorrow morning,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star woke up the next day in his dad&rsquo;s apartment in Taiwan, completely discarding his previous life back in Singapore. It was a fresh change, but something he craved for. His previous routine was miserable, and now, it felt like he was in control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning son, how&rsquo;d you sleep?&rdquo; Skye asked. He was still in his pajamas, pouring a nice cup of coffee with his phone in the other hand. He scrolled the latest news where the headline titled &lsquo;Mysterious Object Scales Shore&rsquo;. &ldquo;You want me to start from the beginning, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star sat down at the kitchen island and stretched out. &ldquo;Enlighten me,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, when you were 3, you had a chronic heart disease. You were our only son, so I tried everything to save you,&rdquo; Skye narrated. &ldquo;I left soon after I realised that it was impossible to cure you, but your mother didn&rsquo;t give up. But when I went on an expedition to Bulan Island, I discovered a black, liquid-like carcass that dripped orange blood. After taking it back to the lab, I-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me guess, you used that orange blood on me and I got cured?&rdquo; Star interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skye chuckled, then gently placed down his mug &ldquo;Yes, but it also caused you to grow your silver eyes and white hair. You used to have black hair and brown eyes. Your skin was also slightly darker as well. Basically so, the blood also gave you powers. Your mother brought you back to her home, Singapore after we realised you caused unnecessary deaths. In other words, you&rsquo;ve had your powers since you were 3, and now and only now are you learning to control them,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know that, but exactly how many people have I killed?&rdquo; Star asked angrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skye sighed, and warned Star with a grim look that he was even embarrassed to say. &ldquo;Approximately 500,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star almost fell out of his chair when he heard the number and struggled to regain his balance. He was absolutely lost for words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sat in silence while his father sipped at his coffee quietly, trying not to disturb his train of thought. 500 deaths was more than he had imagined. He knew his powers were uncontrolled, but this level of danger was too far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve controlled your powers yet, but Barton&rsquo;s eager goals for Anateros to help people could greatly be impacted by you. You could help us do a lot of good with your powers, you know? It makes up for the people you&rsquo;ve killed,&rdquo; Skye offered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s a start. I&#39;m glad I&rsquo;m back with you dad,&rdquo; Star smiled. &ldquo;Can I get a coffee too?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Director Ozim, Beijing is breathing down our necks,&quot; Agent Chen whispered as she slid a classified folder across his desk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim reluctantly opened the file, revealing surveillance photos of Taiwanese military officials meeting with Barton. He sighed, then leant his face into his palms. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did Milo succeed in neutralising Star?&rdquo; Ozim asked worriedly, peeking up from his hands that masked his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s disappeared sir,&rdquo; Agent Chen reported nervously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim slammed against his desk, displacing his pencil holder. He was slightly frustrated that Star was still not controlled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing people and he doesn&rsquo;t know! We can&#39;t have another incident, otherwise our reputation will plummet again! What&rsquo;s the status of Star?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s now with Anateros. That&rsquo;s what our sources say,&rdquo; Agent Chen replied, becoming increasingly more terrified by Ozim&rsquo;s actions. This time, Ozim didn&rsquo;t throw a fit. He didn&#39;t lash out. Instead, he took a deep breath before his next words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, I know. But there&rsquo;s a larger issue at hand. Beijing has also gotten word of this information and is worried of a potential attack. The UN Security Council is already drafting potential solutions about &#39;unregulated supernatural warfare&#39; threatening regional stability.&quot; Chen interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim&#39;s stress was clear. He was lost in thought. &ldquo;I hate politics&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chen&#39;s voice dropped further, continuing from her last point. &quot;Sir, if we don&#39;t contain this situation, Beijing has implied they&#39;ll handle this issue themselves. They&#39;re talking about outright killing Star.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim closed the file, his jaw tightening. &ldquo;We can&#39;t let him die! He&#39;s just another kid like Elias! The ISID is meant to protect humanity from supernatural threats! We&#39;ve helped similar people like the zodiacs. Star isn&#39;t much different!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do we do then sir?&rdquo; Agent Chen asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Ozim leant forward in his chair, he rubbed his forehead painfully. &ldquo;Call and dispatch Elias on this job. I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s busy. This needs to be shut down. China isn&rsquo;t going to be happy with us if we fail this commission,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This wasn&#39;t the first time the ISID had called him. It was a date night, and he hated to be interrupted on special occasions. But ISID considered this to be urgent, and he expected any case directed to him was the most notorious and difficult. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, there wasn&#39;t really a notoriously difficult case ever for Elias Novem. He had gotten a master&#39;s degree in anthropology when he was younger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you serious? At this time? Fine. Whatever. $25,000? Alright. I&#39;m on it,&rdquo; Elias sighed, hanging up. &ldquo;Sorry babe, but work called again, another case,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Again? Fine. Better not miss next time,&rdquo; his girlfriend scoffed, dissatisfied yet again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star jumped onto his cosmic hoverboard and flew off into the skies, actively chasing his target. &ldquo;Any insight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Target&#39;s name is Star Sun. He has abilities to absorb and reflect all types of electromagnetic radiation,&rdquo; Agent Chen explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A light user eh?&rdquo; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Remember, he&#39;s dangerous. Neutralise him and bring him to us. Don&#39;t fail Novem, you&#39;re our last hope. If you can&#39;t do this, no one can. The stake of hundreds of innocent lives is at risk,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I won&#39;t fail, I&#39;m Elias Novem!&rdquo; Elias grinned side to side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hours passed when Elias finally arrived in Japan. He was desperately craving some food, so he stopped for the night for ramen and some sleep. Afterall, he was human. He needed sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias continued his search for Star in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Update on Star: We&#39;ve gotten insider information that he&#39;s training with Anateros. He&#39;s been learning how to fight stronger and sharper,&rdquo; Agent Chen informed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure. I think I&#39;ve gotten a reading of him training above the sea,&rdquo; Elias replied. &ldquo;I&#39;ll update you and Ozim soon,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite the warnings Chen had given, Elias thought little. He could handle various situations and even in the worst of them, always find a clever solution. As he approached the target, a pale white silhouette emerged upon the serene waters of the South China Sea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you Star?&rdquo; Elias asked, facing the hovering boy with white hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes? Who might you be?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Elias Novem, I work for the ISID. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to fight, but you&rsquo;re becoming a big threat to humanity right now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right here? Are you serious?&rdquo; Star scoffed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hovering right above the South China Sea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it minimises collateral damage,&rdquo; Elias laughed off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to the ISID!&rdquo; Star grunted, lunging towards Elias. Elias launched off his cosmic hoverboard, dodging Star&rsquo;s attack. Star quickly turned invisible with the sun shining directly against his body, reflecting UV rays towards Elias. Elias stumbled forward, reeling from the hit, swinging blindly in the air. He didn&rsquo;t know where Star was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias lunged down into the cold waters of the sea to slow down the UV burns. As he peeped above the waters, Star emerged, striking Elias but to no avail. The waters helped Elias dodge, refracting the light, slowing his movements. Star struggled slightly underwater due to the water absorbing some of the light, but enough refracted light helped him maintain his energy levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see you now, flash!&rdquo; Elias laughed, launching off a cosmic weight he created. As he traversed the waters, he manifested mirrors in certain locations. &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mirrors? I see through your trap. I know how light works!&rdquo; Star exclaimed, avoiding hitting the mirrors to end up in an endless loop. The two traded blows at each other causing large waves upon the sea surface, with Star throwing a deadly punch on Elias that sent him flying out of the waters. &ldquo;No more underwater playtime!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle continued. It was truly intense, each attack being blocked or countered. Each UV ray Star directed was reflected by a cosmic mirror Elias created, and Elias&rsquo;s cosmic manifestations were outsped every time he tried to attack. The two were exhausted after hours, both landing with a deafening thud on the southern shore of Taiwan. They were back to where they had started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you killed me?&rdquo; Elias groaned, all tired and wet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Avidrene right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah and? What&rsquo;s killing going to do for me?&rdquo; Star scoffed, coughing up sand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we fighting for then?&rdquo; Elias asked dumbfoundingly. He sighed as he watched the clouds overhead pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh manically, then turning to his side to see Elias needing a break. &ldquo;Ourselves I guess,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Being a detective makes me question everything,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;I studied anthropology and got a masters&rsquo;, and here I am, some superhero unable to complete his mission. This world baffles me,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fight like a human,&rdquo; Star interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not technically human, like you. We&rsquo;re both hybrids used as weapons by our respective owners&hellip;&rdquo; Elias replied. He sat up, dusting off the sand off his indigo costume. &ldquo;Let me tell you, I know what Avidrenes are better than anyone else. My closest friend is a Jespan, and she&rsquo;s told me that Avidrenes in ancient times were the predator of Jespans,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star jerked up, shaking the sand out of his hair. &ldquo;What? You&rsquo;re saying Avidrenes are predators so I&rsquo;m supposed to be stronger than you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Avidrenes are creatures of the sun. After the Jespans discovered the mythical mineral of Orichalcum, they fought back against the Avidrenes,&rdquo; Elias clarified. He sighed again, then lent out a hand. &ldquo;Team-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Us? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be destined enemies?&rdquo; Star asked reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who says? No one writes the rules better than us. Plus, if both of our parent companies are up to no good, it&rsquo;s better if we do something. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re unstoppable together,&rdquo; Elias offered, giving a concerned look deep into Star&rsquo;s silver eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star shook his hand firmly and closed his eyes. &ldquo;Elias was it? You seriously trust me with my powers&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If trust isn&rsquo;t the most powerful thing, then we&rsquo;d have no purpose,&rdquo; Elias smiled, helping Star up. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go catch a break,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two circled the South China Sea, getting the steam off their chest. It wasn&#39;t much, but the two found this method to be relaxing. The serene sounds of the waves with the ambient wind and chirps muffled all the noise outside. Star was alone in mind, finally having no thoughts fog his vision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is so nice&hellip;&rdquo; Star said happily, bathing in the golden sunlight. It felt extremely calming now that he knew he needed to control his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Controlling your powers isn&#39;t hard. It&#39;s about how you use them,&rdquo; Elias chuckled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Star agreed, slowly coming to the realisation that they weren&#39;t so different after all. &ldquo;You really enjoy anthropology, don&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias smirked, glancing at Star who threw a silly laugh. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I still don&#39;t understand how your creations work,&rdquo; Star playfully mocked as he plopped himself in the sea to cool down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s cosmic energy. I can manifest it into tangible objects,&rdquo; Elias grinned, flexing a massive longsword that he had just created out of thin air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sunset marked the slow flight back to the shore, where the two needed to figure out where exactly they needed to go next. It was quite difficult making a move, with both the ISID and Anateros watching over their two children.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dawn sang a quiet melody that woke Star up. The two had found a nice hotel to stay the night, and were enjoying each others&rsquo; company. The half-opened window allowed the cool, crisp morning air to seep into the cozy hotel room where Star woke to a minty sensation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was something happening. Something unusual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias! Wake up!&rdquo; Star nudged the half-asleep Elias until he frustratingly turned over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Elias replied scornfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star pointed out the window, towards the empty horizon. &ldquo;Look. What&#39;s that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, a black cloud emerged. As it got closer, tiny black specks that looked to be helicopters came into view and Elias knew something was wrong. Ozim had tracked where he was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shit! Ozim thinks I&#39;m captured! This is bad!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well what do we do?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s gonna be a war, but we need to try to stop it. If we put our powers together, we&#39;ll get through anything. Let&#39;s roll!&rdquo; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The helicopters weren&#39;t slow at all and began mowing down the southern Taiwan shore. The engines grew closer and battle was imminent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Skye, we need to move. ISID is invading our territory! Arm up and let&#39;s fight. Get me that hypnosis gun, now!&rdquo; Barton ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! Our greatest weapon; my son! We can win and take down Jaxton Ozim!&rdquo; Skye laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Let&#39;s make sure they are disbanded by tonight, shall we?&rdquo; Barton snorted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo; Skye began shooting at the invading ISID helicopters that descended upon their territory. The helicopters dropped men down, where Anateros forces fought back forcefully. Black and purple vested ISID soldiers began emerging from the shore, engaging in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star and Elias were stuck amidst the battle, together. They trusted each other and knew what they were fighting for. No, Elias wasn&#39;t fighting for the ISID as a loyal agent. Neither was Star fighting for Anateros as a family member. They were fighting for themselves, against all odds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle rampaged on from all fronts, the ISID sending in trained agents to quickly deescalate the battle meanwhile Anateros directed elite fighters to minimise damage against their laboratory. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Help me here!,&rdquo; Barton ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right away sir,&rdquo; his pilot replied, getting the helicopter ready. It stealthily found its way into the skies, the engines being masked by the tyrannical sounds of battle. Star sped around the battlefield, disarming and knocking out soldiers. He knew not to kill them, but to minimise the conflict between the two sides. He didn&#39;t want any unnecessary deaths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He got away with the serum!&rdquo; Star yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait Star! Don&#39;t chase after them!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, creating a rope to pull him back. But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You need to learn to control better,&rdquo; Barton informed menacingly. &ldquo;Skye! Let me help you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Star paused, realising what was happening. Barton snickered from the helicopter, aiming his rifle at him. A roaring boom sent a deadly toxin towards Star who didn&#39;t react in time, inhaling the chemicals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star! Don&rsquo;t worry! I&rsquo;ll guide you!&rdquo; Skye exclaimed. &ldquo;It&#39;s my hypnosis serum! Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t hurt you any bit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The serum worked quite effectively as Star jumped up after falling back onto the ground, causing ISID helicopters to come crashing down in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was forced to create nets to catch the soldiers who operated the planes, making sure not a single life was taken. He knew Star better. He knew Star would never want to do anything like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias looked up, Barton was long gone with the serum taken away. Was he going to create another hybrid? It was too risky to follow him. He needed to save Star right here and right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ace, I know you&#39;re in there!&rdquo; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! Don&#39;t listen to him! He&#39;s manipulating you!&rdquo; Skye yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaaargh!&rdquo; Star yelled, letting out an uncontrolled burst. His scream tore through the valleys and ripped into the sky. A chain of concentrated UV rays tore through the landscape, rapidly destroying nearby organisms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; Elias yelled. He couldn&#39;t do anything. He was powerless against Skye. He was Star&#39;s dad. Star, who was still in immense pain, tried to fight back against the control serum, trying to regain his powers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! The International Supernatural Intelligence Division has my son as the most wanted supernatural anomaly! I won&#39;t allow you to kill him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re not trying to kill him!&rdquo; Elias yelled. &ldquo;I didn&#39;t even know that he was the most wanted either!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s what they all say!&rdquo; Skye spat, unloading another magazine of the gun. Elias formed another shield, blocking every bullet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Star, kill him! Without </span><span class="c9">him</span><span class="c0">, the ISID will never thrive!&rdquo; Skye ordered. Star&#39;s body thrusted forward, lunging towards Elias. Elias didn&#39;t flinch, nor did he dodge. He knew who was inside that body. He knew his limitations. He closed his eyes and the speeding flash missed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star was internally fighting the battle of his life. His father&rsquo;s words lingered deep, penetrating through his heart and into his soul.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Star! You told me and Barton you wanted the world to be a better place right?&rdquo; the words etched. Meanwhile, Elias&rsquo;s enchanting persona carved into his mind, encouraging for who he was. &ldquo;No one writes better rules than us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, something had cut through the voices, something that silenced the vibrations. It was a boiling hot sensation that ruptured all the lies. He had never felt such power before being enchanted into his body. There was only one explanation to this. The sun was at its peak, and the light had shone through the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would kill you but I&#39;ve promised to never kill anyone again,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;Let me ask you the question: Do you think the Sun rules the sky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A blinding flash struck Skye. He gasped for air as another hit pummelled against his stomach. &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d do this&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun had struck noon and Star had achieved his peak strength, able to absorb all of the light that was cast upon him from the sun. For a minute, he was untouchable, invincible. Elias remained still, without a single movement. Chaos followed Star everywhere as his powers surged, the energy of the sun overflowing. He squirmed and spasmed everywhere, while still trying to maintain himself through the hypnosis dart. Although the energy seemed uncontrolled, Star somehow maintained balance within.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Star! Kill him! You&#39;re invincible!&rdquo; Skye yelled. &ldquo;Trust me son! You are </span><span class="c9">our </span><span class="c0">ace card!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&#39;t listen to anyone!&rdquo; Star roared, almost going supernova with the sheer amount of light absorbed. His vision began to flash, unable to see ahead of him. Instead of the grim barrage of gun-fire and conflict, death, decay and violent visions reentered his sights. It felt surreal, as if he had gone back in time and saw a different perspective of his killings. An invincible machine at noon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star knew he couldn&#39;t control it, but he had some idea of nullifying the damage he would cause. He sped towards the sea and dove deep, letting his excess energy explode into the deep sea. The sudden plunge into the chilling waters fractured the hypnosis, snapping himself out of his rampage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The stored light energy within his body exploded outwards into sharp piercing beams, creating a small shockwave underwater, destroying nearby organisms. Of course Star knew this would happen as water was a great absorber of UV, and this catastrophically reduced the risk of a surface level explosion of his UV energy. He remained underwater, slowly floating towards the surface. The warm, refracted light slowly seeped into his body yet again, giving him strength to continue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Try me,&rdquo; Elias smirked, glancing towards the horizon. His ignorance frustrated Skye, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;You monster&hellip;&rdquo; Skye wheezed. He wasn&#39;t extremely injured, but in pain. &ldquo;My son&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias sighed, his voice filled with disappointment. Though the battle was long over, he saw Skye was still lost in his head. Star, was still nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t over!&rdquo; Skye yelled as he lunged towards Elias. Again, he stood still, knowing exactly what would happen. He had no intent to fight. Just like he presumed, Star bolted up in an instant and gripped his father&#39;s fist of fury, stopping him right in his tracks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad! It&#39;s no use. Stop hurting my friend!&rdquo; Star yelled. &ldquo;The hypnosis! You made it for me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Skye hesitated, then lowered his fist and reverted his stance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s just that&hellip;You don&#39;t accept me for who I am&hellip;You don&#39;t trust me, but I&#39;m actually all grown up&hellip;I&#39;m fine right now and I understand that I&#39;m not a human anymore. But either way, I&#39;m still your son!&rdquo; Star blurted. He hugged his father tightly. &ldquo;I love you, dad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His father paused for a moment, unable to process what was happening. Elias smiled, realising Star still had so much potential. The Son of the Sun. An Avidrenes-Human hybrid. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you saying son?&rdquo; Skye asked. &ldquo;Am I&hellip;wrong? Should I have not saved you back then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you&#39;ve made me realise my purpose, and my need for control and change,&rdquo; Star smiled tiredly. He was exhausted from controlling himself from the hypnosis. &ldquo;Just&hellip;believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s right. Although you worked with Anateros, I&#39;ll let you off the hook.&rdquo; Elias explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ISID helicopters began to descend in peace, ready to collect Elias back. Anateros stood their ground firm, though not aggressive towards the ISID. For once, the two companies were neutral. No fight, just peace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Armed ISID men cuffed Skye for now, needing to confirm if Barton&rsquo;s evil scheme had to do with manipulating the Taiwanese government. His bounty was indeed high, so any affiliations were tense. Then, two shadowy figures emerged from the helicopter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The public collateral damage was low, but the suspended battle along the southern shore still disturbed the public, causing public riot. Media and news outlets had already begun to document this conflict, and the Mainland Government was eyeing Taiwan&#39;s actions very closely. The true battle was far from over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, what the hell are you thinking?&rdquo; Ozim yelled as he got off the helicopter. &ldquo;We need to go, now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not going back yet. I&#39;ve got something I need to do.&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, his voice filled with enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! You can&rsquo;t just deny my orders, we need you back at base!&rdquo; Ozim demanded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star, care to join me to take down a Jespan Lord? This one&#39;s having a bloodbath in Alaska,&rdquo; Elias grinned, excited for their next adventure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You sure duo?&rdquo; Star replied. &ldquo;Call me Ace now on. I&#39;m not digging Star anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two flew off into the sky, radiating immense energy that was strong enough to tear apart any challenges that faced their way. Ozim watched in disappointment, but knew that Elias was a special boy. One that radiated kindness and the qualities of a great leader. Skye watched in hope, believing his son could finally see that the sky was not a mere limit. Ace could finally see the light clearer than ever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
