That was the motto of the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. Operated in the depths of Indianapolis, the division had recently received a bizarre mystery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Tom, we&#39;re stumped...The men, all twenty-three of them we&#39;ve sent...they&#39;ve all gone missing without a trace!&quot; Barry said, his voice lingering in concern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tom dropped his head into his hands and looked down, with nothing but frustration in his mind. &quot;I know! I know! Can you please shut up? What am I supposed to do?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What about the intern? Crazy smart 19-year-old kid, who finished a master&#39;s in anthropology! He said he&#39;s coming in today!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m not risking it! I could be fired!&quot; Tom yelled, slamming his fist into the desk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The door slowly creaked open upon Tom&#39;s last words, as a dark silhouette appeared, fading in, uncloaking a boy with wavy umber hair and a pair of mystic black eyes of death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear you two,&quot; the boy smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who are you?&quot; Tom asked, still angry. The boy gracefully ran his fingers through his hair, flicking it backwards. Barry, disappointed, facepalmed and swivelled around on his chair, regaining his attention to his computer where he was halfway through his work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;El-&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re Elias right?&quot; Tom interrupted. Barry couldn&#39;t hold his laughter and giggled, frustrating Tom even more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There&#39;s a case here. The Mona Lisa, 23 disappearances. Some say there&#39;s a curse attached, but I don&#39;t buy it,&quot; Tom mumbled, tossing a folder toward Elias. &quot;Read through that, and good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias caught the folder, flipping through the file&#39;s sparse notes and thinking back to what had led him here. He knew of his talents that paved this path, and he knew if it meant facing off with a so-called cursed painting, so be it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Still, Elias disliked this ignorant attitude, catching the folder with ease. He quickly flipped through it and skimmed the brief, highlighting the phrase: &quot;23 Disappearances on this Case&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well? What are you waiting for?&quot; Tom yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Jesus Tom! Shut the fuck up!&quot; Barry interrupted. &quot;He&#39;s the fucking intern!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The plane flight was tedious, but Elias pulled through the jet lag and landed in Paris. He&#39;d never been to Europe and had only seen media of it, and experiencing everything all at once was like a dream come true. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Louvre was more than an experience, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see, to view ancient paintings, artifacts and stories. The faint scent of polished wood and stone of the Louvre mingled with the lingering breath of time as Elias entered the grandeur rooms of the exhibition, emitting a magical aura. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias was careful, not to seem suspicious. He slowly made his way towards the Mona Lisa painting, where the majority of the people had gathered around. Suddenly, a hand rested on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias turned around, shocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Been a while, hasn&#39;t it Elias?&quot; James smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;James? I haven&#39;t seen you since high school!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What brings you here?&quot; James asked. &quot;I&#39;m here on vacation!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Work for me,&quot; Elias said, rolling his eyes. &quot;Got into a supernatural intelligence division...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Really? That sounds cool!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;The people there are dicks,&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s unfortunate...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, this is my first case, and it&#39;s about the Mona Lisa...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Did you know, the Mona Lisa has a flaw? I&#39;ve heard rumours that DaVinci has a badly placed stroke near the hands...&quot; James remarked. James walked forward for a better view and reached out, pointing at the flaw. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Don&#39;t get that close!&quot; Elias chirped. James didn&#39;t hear Elias through the thick noise produced by the crowd, unaware of his surroundings. Then, a man pushed forward through the crowd, bumping James and making him lose his balance. His hand unfortunately scraped the painting, leaving a faint mark on it as he descended and landed on the ground with an oof.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;James! Are you good?&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine- Argh!&quot; James screamed as he got up. His hand was gone, literally cut off, but there was no blood surprisingly. His hand had seemed to disappear out of thin air, Elias considering that James&#39;s hand might have been translated into a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Aaah!&quot; a man screamed, fading away. Elias&#39;s eyes darted around the room and witnessed people disappearing, along with their body parts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Elias yelled. He drew his attention back to the Mona Lisa painting. The woman in the painting was gone and chaos had begun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias! Help! Help me-&quot; James screamed as the rest of his body faded away, leaving only his face. It wasn&#39;t long before everything went dark for Elias, for he was also transferred into a new, magical realm. It was indeed dark, Elias&#39;s vision was engulfed with shadows and only after what seemed to be hours, did Elias finally slowly open his tired eyes to see the clear blue sky. James quickly approached Elias and leaned down, helping Elias up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias! You&#39;re awake!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Where are we?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Didn&#39;t you major in history? You should know this!&quot; James panicked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Jesus, it&#39;s anthropology, not history. I&#39;ll take a look,&quot; Elias replied frailly. &quot;It can&#39;t be...This isn&#39;t our world...We&#39;re in a different dimension...It feels like it...And it also feels like we&#39;re in 16th-century Europe!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;We need to get outta here,&quot; a man said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I agree,&quot; James added. &quot;But where do we start?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;There...&quot; Elias announced. He pointed towards a small flight of stairs that began just up ahead, just beyond the path. A massive castle stood upon them, and the only thing that blocked them from entering it was the set of doors. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they crossed the cobbled footpath and descended the flight of stairs, a small sign with the word &quot;Library&quot; in serif letters was placed beside the door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">James pushed the creaking wooden door open, flooding the pitch-black library with the bright sunlight. The walls were infested with mould and cracks, implying the abandoned nature of the structure. The bookshelves seemed untouched, with them reaching to the ceiling, acting as pillars of some sort. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias carefully stepped into the library, with the dust-ridden floor creating squeaky sounds that echoed amongst the bookshelves. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Look at all this dirt, guh!&quot; a woman exclaimed. &quot;Those cobwebs! Yuck!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Indeed, the library seemed abandoned, but the books seemed clean, and shinier than anything else in place. It certainly contrasted the dull brown palette adopted by the library, creating somewhat of a welcoming yet ominous atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Phones everyone! Turn your flashlight on and start looking around!&quot; Elias commanded. It was suddenly much brighter with the addition of the flashlights, making it much easier to navigate the labyrinth-like layout of a library.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey! Now isn&#39;t the time to smoke Howard...&quot; a woman barked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Lisa, this helps me calm down!&quot; Howard explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Smoking? Great! Give me that lighter!&quot; Elias exclaimed. Howard stood in shock, with his lighter in his hand. Elias snatched it and smiled. &quot;Thanks, man, and don&#39;t smoke in here,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">James helped Elias light the candles in the library, adding some natural light that helped illuminate the darkness and help conserve the batteries of their phones. It was much cosier now that there was some sort of light, and hence they were able to begin exploring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Look at this Elias, a book.&quot; James signalled. He picked the book titled &quot;Divine Arts&quot; up from a nearby table and flipped it open. People nearby huddled beside James, trying to read the contents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;May the most tender item lead to a graceful flight. Maybe sometimes you must not just paint through the night.&quot; Elias read. &quot;I&#39;m assuming tender refers to the youngest thing in the library...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;ll start checking the books,&quot; a woman added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Same here!&quot; another chirped in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&#39;t long before everyone began to search for the youngest thing. Elias didn&#39;t care about the books, he pondered on the statement as he explored the library.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many people began inspecting the bookshelves to analyse the most recent books, but there was no luck. Instead of success, only misfortune came in the shape of fantastical yet horrendous monsters. The books the people checked slowly transformed into horrible, bloodthirsty creatures with a pair of wings and sharp, pointy teeth. They were relentlessly chasing whoever opened them and chomping their arms, legs or even heads off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The group was in shambles, screams filled the maze of bookshelves and chaos was imminent. Panic quickly arose and Elias realised that this was nothing he had done before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Youngest...&quot; Elias thought. &quot;Time...?&quot; Elias gazed at the grandfather clock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias...doesn&#39;t this look like the Mona Lisa?&quot; James interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What does?&quot; Elias asked while he remained lost in thought by the grandfather clock. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;That canvas...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias darted his eyes to the green canvas, realising that it was indeed the half-finished Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I know where we are...and I think I know how to get out...&quot; Elias muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hurry up! There&#39;s a ghost coming!&quot; James screamed. Elias again, turned around to see in shock the abomination of a ghost that faded into existence. A devilish green monster, plagued with ridiculous wrinkles and demon red eyes appeared, of what seemed to resemble the Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You dare fool around here?&quot; the Mona Lisa hissed. In the background, the constant flapping of book monsters ticked Elias, annoying him ever so more. The gruesome squeals of pain and death were inevitable, as the book monsters began slowly consuming the remaining people one by one. It was complete chaos and all some could do was run; they didn&#39;t have time to mourn the death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Go, distract the ghost!&quot; Elias directed, taking out his gun. He loaded a magazine into the gun and aimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What? How?&quot; James asked. However, it was too late for Elias had already run back and began shooting a few book monsters down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Mona Lisa took advantage of James as he didn&#39;t know how to distract her, crawling into his skin and haunting him. James was scared. It felt like thousands of glass shards had pierced his skin, and the sensation of the ghostly figure phasing through his body made him tremble with utter fear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His breath hitched, coming in shallow gasps, followed by his heart beating at the speed of light, forcing cold sweat to drip from his forehead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Please...Don&#39;t kill me!&quot; James wailed as he stumbled to the ground. He gazed up, the Mona Lisa loomed over him with a deathly stare. Her eyes were like the devil&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Back off!&quot; Elias shouted, firing a bullet at the Mona Lisa. The bullet phased through the ghostly properties of her body, striking the wall. The Mona Lisa somehow felt the sensation of an object passing through her body and turned her attention towards Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Mona Lisa slowly closed the distance between it and Elias and mumbled, &quot;Why do humans trespass on this sacred land?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Fuck! One bullet left...&quot; Elias exclaimed as he inspected the barrel. &quot;Unless...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; James yelled. Elias hesitated, quickly scanning the area again to make sure he was right. He knew something was off about the location and that there was a much larger problem with higher stakes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, the grandfather clock struck midday, and the pendulum swung back and forth and produced a deafening vibration that paralysed the Mona Lisa in place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias suddenly realised that time was the key, and that the grandfather clock played a vital role in the solution of the curse. There was this strange tingling sensation that suddenly crawled underneath his skin, making Elias feel the weight of his decision. What if he was wrong? What if this would seal them all here forever? He glanced at James, whose face was pale with fear but who managed a nod of trust.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No more ghosts,&quot; Elias muttered, steadying his hand. With a deep breath and on the third strike of the pendulum, he pulled the trigger. The gunshot echoed through the room, shattering the canvas in a blink of an eye. For a moment, silence engulfed the room, and Elias stood firm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Why did you shoot the canvas?&quot; James wailed. &quot;Now we&#39;re never getting out!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No, James. We are getting out. Da Vinci&#39;s intention in painting the Mona Lisa was to emphasise the beauty and mystery of life, and there appears to be a mistake that seems to oppose the perfect values Da Vinci had imagined,&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What, the Mona Lisa is ugly?&quot; James replied. The Mona Lisa suddenly slipped, falling face first on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, exactly. This isn&#39;t the real world, but rather a manifestation of Da Vinci&#39;s dream,&quot; Elias explained. &quot;These are fragments of his thoughts that have still lingered after his death.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re saying the Mona Lisa is impure and there&#39;s something fucked up about it?&quot; James questioned. The Mona Lisa began to become more transparent by the second. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Remember the flaw you noticed in the painting? That stroke may be the curse itself, the imperfection that haunted him. By breaking down these illusions, we&#39;re dismantling how Da Vinci saw the Mona Lisa after death!&quot; Elias added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Mona Lisa had vanished from existence with no trace left behind. The book monsters fell to the ground, one by one like targets on a shooting range. The curse was slowly fading and so did they too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;His view, poisoned by a single mistake, became a curse. Now that it&#39;s destroyed, people will accept its beauty, and as we return to the present, time will heal the memory of that flaw.&quot; Elias continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait...I think we&#39;re going back! We just lifted the curse!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, we did it. Let&#39;s go!&quot; Elias laughed. The surviving bunch cheered, and then a violent force suddenly tugged on everyone&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait what&#39;s happening?&quot; James screamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; another commented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Help!&quot; another added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One by one, they were pulled towards the mysterious portal, with the ground slipping away beneath them. Arms flailed and voices shouted as they struggled against the unseen force. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s our way out! Hold on!&quot; Elias clenched his fists and closed his eyes, hoping for the best and surviving the trip back to reality. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The air around them grew thinner by the minute, vibrating with energy as the portal&#39;s centre opened wider, pulsing with a strange, otherworldly light. It swallowed them whole, one by one until only the echo of their voices remained in the space they left behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wake up...&quot; Elias mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh?&quot; James groaned. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You passed out for a good hour...&quot; Elias explained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh...&quot; James stood up and gathered his balance with Elias&#39;s help. His hand was back, though the ones that died in that realm were still gone. Elias didn&#39;t think people would die in front of them, yet a ghost appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Guess that&#39;s one case I&#39;ll never forget,&quot; Elias remarked, with a slight smirk on his face. He glanced back at the Mona Lisa, now back to normal and felt finally relieved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despite the case being solved, an uneasy feeling entered his mind of a domino effect and a chain of the most bizarre cases ever raised by mankind. Elias stood there and gazed at the painting for a final time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Without warning, a loud bang echoed through the room as the entrance door was flung wide open in a split second. Several armed security men barged into the Louvre, surrounding Elias and the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Freeze!&quot; the guard shouted. &quot;Who are you all? How did you get in here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait a minute...That painting...It&#39;s back to normal!&quot; another guard exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who did this?&quot; another guard questioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias stepped forward with his hands in the pockets of his large navy jacket and began, &quot;Well excuse me men, I did. I&#39;d suppose you&#39;d want to hear the whole story, so, picture this...&quot;</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.eht4ae8qj3vo"><span class="c8">Ajespa&rsquo;s Acrimony #2</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The stars shone like clusters of crystals in the pitch-black sky, slowly flickering ever so brightly. The midnight scent was fresh, with a hint of rainwater. The breeze gently brushed against her lavender hair, as she walked down the streets of Ajespa, the city that never slept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Ajespa thrived on its nightlife, providing residents with numerous nightclubs, delicious street food vendors, 24/7 arcades, and other amazing services. Along with the serene landscapes and dazzling flowers in the daytime, Ajespa was almost like a fantasy world, lingering with otherworldly atmospheres. Yet, she felt alone in the dream-like city. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The miraculous city built in just 19 years out of nothing was truly a feat for mankind. What started as a mere shelter turned into a vibrant cityscape, with buildings piercing the sky and shops of various goods. But Rae didn&#39;t think much of this feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She trudged along the footpath up towards the mountaintop, climbing towards the peak that loomed over the valley. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ah, there you are...Rae Lioni. Your father says dinner is ready...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She silently sat on the cliff&#39;s edge and smiled, unfazed that she was half dangling off the cliff. The view of the valley allowed her to see the suburban areas of the city, where she had come from. The sound of the waterfall beneath her slowly filled the silence as the water rushed out, creating a calming sensation that soothed her mind of all negativities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Barton, why can&#39;t I go explore the world?&quot; Rae began. She toyed with her hair, as the gentle evening breeze sent a cold and fuzzy feeling inside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae, do you keep forgetting? You are the princess of Ajespa, you must continue the legacy...to protect our sacred kingdom!&quot; Barton exclaimed. Rae had nothing to say to Barton&#39;s statement and remained in solitude, listening to the ambience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m going to go for a walk,&quot; Rae sighed, standing up. &quot;Tell Father that I won&#39;t be there for dinner,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae was alone in such a big city. Even with the most advanced technology, she couldn&#39;t find anyone in person or online who would listen to her or be willing to befriend her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Princess! What are you doing here?&quot; the locals asked as Rae passed the food stalls, down the main road. Rae didn&#39;t reply, for she disliked the amount of publicity she had as the princess. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The streets were busy as usual, the flickering of neon signs and holographic text, igniting the paradise. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Rae couldn&#39;t help to notice one thing; a rather odd symbol almost stamped on all the large cardboard boxes that were filled with goods. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What company is supplying this?&quot; Rae asked a merchant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Great question! I don&#39;t know!&quot; the merchant replied happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Good one! M&#39;lady, the company is called Anateros,&quot; a voice spoke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yeah! Anateros!&quot; the merchant added. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Sounds sketchy...&quot; Rae remarked, crossing her arms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you going do? Report us to security? Oh wait...there isn&#39;t any here!&quot; the merchant laughed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, just wait!&quot; Rae snapped, walking away. She grabbed her phone and jumped onto the internet search bar, her fingers frantically typing the words: &quot;Private Investigation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The engine produced millions of results at lightning speed, but one at the top immediately caught her eye. No, there was no mistake. She knew she had been searching bizarre things on the internet but for something to be this personal, Rae knew exactly what the service could do to her. There it was, on the page, the American Supernatural Intelligence Division.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae quickly snapped a few photos of the streets and then rushed home, filling out the form for a case. She had high hopes that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime to find out the secrets that the city had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias Novem was bored. Elias stared at the mundane white ceiling of his apartment, laying on his bed peacefully. The ASID wasn&#39;t kind enough to give Elias many cases, and having a long drought of cases, Elias was ecstatic when his phone vibrated a light green; it signalled to him that Tom had called. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias! I&#39;m here to assign you to your next case. Our top detectives are all busy working together on another case; hence we need you to solve this case!&quot; Tom laughed. &quot;It&#39;s in Georgia, we&#39;ll send you the details!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What?&quot; Before Elias could begin and put together his thoughts, Tom had hung up and all Elias could hear was the silent static that rang in his ear. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A red notification bubble suddenly alerted Elias upright once again, with the contents containing a single PDF file. Elias, hesitant to accept the case, opened the file to view the contents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The file introduced Ajespa, the city of wonder and Elias was hooked immediately. The photos present were bright and colourful, radiating with energy and hinting at an uneasy feeling of modernism. Elias rang Tom again, now standing up and changing into his navy jacket, excited to finally go on a case again. Elias was ready for adventure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What?&quot; Tom demanded with an arrogant tone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;When&#39;s my flight?&quot; Elias questioned, a grin appearing on his face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Tomorrow morning, 8 am. Get some rest kid,&quot; Tom replied calmly, then hung up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~ </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias finally reached Ajespa, where the commotion was high, and the mysteries were unsolved. What appeared as mountains to the naked eye, Elias recognised as a complex of mazes, marked by man-made signs that hinted at ancient ruins. He wandered the streets of Ajespa like a boy in a candy store; it was like a dreamland. It was too good to be true.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Jeez, who&#39;s the client? And what is this mystery?&quot; Elias thought to himself. Gazing at his surroundings, Elias witnessed several merchant stores and fresh food markets, tucked away in the open ground floor of the towering skyscrapers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Get fresh meat for only 200 Lari!&quot; a vendor announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What are those absurd prices?&quot; Elias commented, throwing his hands up in disbelief. He approached the vendor to confront him about the prices. The vendor was a stout man with a wide grin, wiping his hands on an apron stained from a day&#39;s work. His stall was filled with an array of meats, wrapped in waxy paper, organised neatly into four evenly spaced rows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Two hundred Lari for meat? You do know people aren&#39;t made of money, right?&quot; Elias said, folding his arms as he stared down the merchant. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The merchant didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, he chuckled, looking Elias up and down. &quot;What are you, a foreigner? These prices are normal! We get these quality meats from Anateros!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Anateros?&quot; Elias questioned. &quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t even know of Anateros?&quot; the vendor scoffed, leaning forward. He stared down Elias, sending a terrible shiver down his spine that spooked him to the core. The vendor pointed towards the machine in the back, specifically at the logo that was engraved into the machine. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The structure was composed of two triangular shapes: a small, compact one and a tall, slender one, arranged side-by-side to convey strength and precision. &quot;Let me give you a quick history lesson, newbie. Anateros is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and they are the cornerstone of this city. Without them, we would be broken into pieces!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias sighed, turned away, and trudged down the bustling streets, only to notice the same logo everywhere he went. It was stuck in his head, with the imbalance of symmetry sparking new ideas in his head. Was this company the cornerstone of the city? What are their true motivations? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Anateros...sounds Greek-ish...&quot; Elias mumbled, focusing on his thoughts. Elias was lost in his logic and kept walking forward, slowly losing focus on his way forward and tilting his head down to concentrate. The rhythmic beat of his footsteps only helped him sink deeper into his tangled state of mind, with his eyes tracing the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When the sudden ambience of his footsteps stopped abruptly, Elias felt a strong impact on his body, pushing him backwards. He found himself face-to-face with someone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, quickly passing by Elias. Elias was wonderstruck. That lavender hair and that scarlet silk dress were an enchanting sight for Elias. He had first not seen a woman that beautiful in his life, and second of all, it came to his realisation that she was the princess of Ajespa, the heir to the throne, part of the royal family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Wait a moment!&quot; Elias shouted, quickly turning around. The girl froze and looked behind her to see Elias gazing deep into her eyes. A warm sensation coursed through her, and a mysterious aura drew her closer to Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;My name is Elias Novem, pleased to meet you, princess,&quot; Elias began. &quot;I&#39;ve been tasked by someone from this city for a private investigation?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re the one they sent?&quot; the princess stumbled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, I have been tasked by the American Supernatural Intelligence Division to come investigate the city of Ajespa,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Please call me Rae,&quot; Rae replied. &quot;And I was the one who asked you to come...there&#39;s been a lot happening recently...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Indeed, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read on the news...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Follow me. I want to show you something...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias and Rae ascended the mountain along the footpath to Ajespan Manor, the royal family&#39;s estate. The garden was beautiful, especially during the evening as the sun had cast long beams of light that emphasised the colours of the flowers. The moment Elias stepped into the manor, an unseen, majestic energy enveloped him. It was a mystical aura that filled his mind with wonder. The interior was quite spacious and grandeur, although not matching the futuristic style of the rest of the city, it was littered with vintage items and paintings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Your father is sick Rae. And who&#39;s this fine gentleman?&quot; the butler asked from the second floor, spotting Rae and Elias entering the manor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I made a friend, Barton!&quot; Rae exclaimed. Elias was confused, as he was only just a detective on a case and didn&#39;t consider himself a friend of Rae, especially when he knew that she didn&#39;t have any friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I see...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;His name is Elias...Would father mind if he stayed for the night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh well, I suppose. After all, I&#39;m just a butler, following your father&#39;s orders,&quot; Barton explained. Soon after, he left the room, leaving Elias and Rae alone in the manor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m going to first change out of this dress, it&#39;s a mess,&quot; Rae smiled as she slipped into her room, changing into something more comfortable. It wasn&#39;t long until she was back out and ready to show Elias the bizarre tunnel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, um,&quot; Rae mumbled, swaying from left to right. Elias immediately knew she was quite nervous, slowly moving towards the left side of the manor as if she were trying to direct him. He casually followed Rae&#39;s lead towards a locked door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Since I was young, my dad has never let me through this door. I&#39;ve been so curious for the past few years, so I&#39;ve tried many times, but I&#39;ve been caught,&quot; Rae explained as she picked the lock on the door. Elias watched with worry as he knew if one&#39;s daughter was picking a lock, it was not a good sign of the future. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Anyway, this is the perfect time! Father is sick so we can explore where the door leads. I need help solving this mystery. I can&#39;t do it alone; I need someone smart like you!&quot; Rae smiled, opening the door as she finished her last words. &quot;There! Let&#39;s go...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As they stepped inside, a heavy but gentle gust of air brushed their cheeks, sending a chilling sensation down their spines. Each step they took sent an uneasy tingling feeling into their bodies as the hallway became narrower, they went down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Look at these carvings...&quot; Elias whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I know right? It&#39;s so magical!&quot; Rae replied, giggling a little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The passageway began to slope downward, subtly at first, then more pronounced, and the air grew colder still. Rae saw it first; the hallway had ended right beneath their feet, and it marked the entrance of the dungeons. The sound of dripping water suddenly began echoing from above and Elias almost immediately spotted bones, giving him the chills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This is ancient Georgia, eh?&quot; Elias remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I believe so. This is so cool!&quot; Rae smiled. Soon, they reached an intersection with two doors on either side of the hallway. The left door, forbidding entry with a stern &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign, was firmly locked. However, the right door, bare of any warning, was not locked. Rae slowly pushed the door on the right open and revealed the ominous interior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The room was hollowed out, stretching to the vast size of the mountain&#39;s interior. Inside, nine giant mutant-like robots were neatly organised into a three-by-three grid, each looking like they were built yesterday. There were computers, and tools that lay around on the ground, scattered like a mad sea. Rae and Elias were both frozen in motion, like a stone statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias had read stories of long-lost technologies, but to see them here, in the catacombs of Georgia, silent and unmoving, was surreal. Each robot loomed over him like a metal sentinel, waiting in eternal slumber. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae approached the robot and reached out, her fingers grazing the cold silver. It felt almost alive as if she were touching something ancient, forbidden. Elias moved beside her, his eyes wide with fear and awe. For a moment, neither of them spoke. There was an unseen magical force that suddenly pressed against them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The emptiness of the room seemed to breathe around them, shadows shifting as the faint glow of their flashlights skimmed across hulking metal figures. Although there were nine robots in the room, each of them seemed to be gigantic, roughly about eight times larger than a normal human. They were all encased in layers of silver plating, still shining like it was polished a minute ago. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias carefully weaved through the robots, his hand brushing the cold metal of a robot&#39;s arm. The bulky arms of the robots were cold and hard, knocking them sent a low vibration that echoed through the room. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Meanwhile, Rae took an unconscious step back, the awe in her eyes mingling with a trace of fear. Rae was lost in her thoughts as she gazed at the huge robots. She closely inspected them and found guns attached to their backs and more firearms mounted into their arms. Rae began finding the robots more like war robots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias quickly scanned the room as he reached the other end and approached a small table in the corner. He began searching the tabletop, reaching for the opened book that lay flat on the table, flipping through its contents. He used his phone as an aid to translate passages to help him understand. The task was arduous, and Elias was devoted to learning something new about the mystery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, footsteps echoed down the narrow needle-like hallways of the catacombs, slowly forming an ominous atmosphere cloaked with mystery. Elias quickly snapped photos of the pages and stood beside Rae.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What are we going to do now?&quot; Rae asked. &quot;What if they come here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;There!&quot; Elias murmured sharply, with his finger pointing to a small, unassuming wooden door hidden in the shadows at the far end of the room. Without hesitation, the two sprinted across the room towards the door, tugging it open and slipping inside before quickly pulling it shut behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The footsteps grew louder as the mysterious figure entered the room, now scanning the area. Rae carefully leaned back and gently pressed against Elias&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Elias whispered, wrapping his hand around Rae&#39;s body as he tried to steady his heartbeat. She nodded, exhaling in relief as they stood perfectly still.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmph,&quot; the figure muttered in a frustrated tone. They then marched out of the room. Elias peered through the cracks, catching a glimpse of the figure as he left. He identified the figure as a tall, thin man in a dark shirt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias and Rae struggled for a while but slowly managed to crawl out of the cramped storage room. The two gathered all the information and headed out of the devilish room of robots, and back into the tunnels of the catacombs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go back,&quot; Rae mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hang on, I need to check something. Go on ahead without me, I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; Elias motioned as he approached the locked door. Rae quickly moved on by herself while Elias inspected the &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign much closer, and quickly realised the passkey to the lock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias had realised the combination was a 4-digit code and figured that the number of strokes each word had must have related to the password. Elias quickly counted the strokes and swiftly dialled the code &#39;4616&#39; into the rusty lock. The lock was uneasy to configure, with the numbers getting stuck easily but Elias powered through, and finally, the door magically opened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias gently leaned against the door and carefully pushed it open, unveiling an egg-like capsule in the middle of the room. His gaze fell upon a tattered book page, discarded on the floor. The remaining words displayed:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;For he searched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The essence of the.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And we did advance like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cultivating technology.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Burned us together;&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias thought hard, ultimately resulting in him snapping a photo and leaving, not wanting anything to happen to Rae. Elias quickly rushed out of the room and realised Rae was long gone and was out of his sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae!&quot; Elias called out, echoing through the tunnels. Elias gracefully found his way out, back into the manor. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Looking for the girl, Novem?&quot; a voice crackled. Elias turned to see the man approaching him in his adorned black suit, walking with fashion towards him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You...You aren&#39;t a royal...You&#39;re just a butler!&quot; Elias started, jerking backwards and positioning himself into a better stance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Of course, the Royal Family are just puppets of mine. This city, what you are seeing is just a fraction of my wealth!&quot; the butler laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, Anateros is where I&#39;ll start disassembling your wealth,&quot; Elias snapped, slowly backing away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh? Getting your hopes up high, I see.&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I already know everything!&quot; Elias exclaimed. &quot;This is just the beginning, and I will take you down...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias pushed the doors open of the manor and stepped outside, finally able to catch his breath. He sighed a deep sigh of relief and quickly regained his energy, then stood up and read over his notes again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Opening his notes app, Elias carefully analysed his findings. &quot;Strange robots are hidden in catacombs. According to history, in 1551, the Persians invaded Vardzia, where Ajespa stood. Unless the Georgians had hid something here...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A sudden realisation ignited in Elias&#39;s mind as if a match had struck him aflame. Returning to the passage, Elias finally deciphered its meaning, discovering that the Georgians had hidden a treasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Now if I can just find Rae...&quot; Elias muttered, contemplating whether he should barge back into the manor. Elias decided to play it cool and waited, hiding in the nearby bushes. Soon enough the butler stepped outside the manor, checking his surroundings then jumping into a car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go to Vroti Tower,&quot; the butler commanded. The chauffeur nodded, starting the car. As he drove, Elias strained to hear the conversation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias arrived at the tower soon after, holding a sinking feeling throughout his journey. The tower certainly felt like a trap and Elias was weary of it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Help me...&quot; a voice rang. A slight tapping of glass echoed from above, followed by a sudden static whirring noise alarmed Elias, who jolted backwards at the flickering of the screen. The massive screen in the lobby suddenly turned on, with the butler&#39;s face on it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#65532; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hello Novem, looks like we meet again. What a sneaky little rat you are!&quot; the butler laughed. &quot;So, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve seen the War robots, eh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What?&quot; Elias sputtered, reassembling his thoughts completely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Those robots underground, in the catacombs! Don&#39;t lie, I can smell that scent from you! They will soon rise and help Anateros become a more powerful company!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;So, I assumed...&quot; Elias smirked, grinning. He was unfazed by the impending doom and pieced together the puzzle in his mind, now with his logic all cleared and actions unclouded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ha! As if you&#39;re a superhero!&quot; the butler laughed hysterically. He quickly turned off the camera that displayed his face and switched it to a different view of two cameras pointing at two distinct subjects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I know you&#39;ve come to like the royal, so let&#39;s play a game, Novem,&quot; the butler giggled. The screen was split into two, with the first camera pointing towards Rae, being tied up by the hands. The camera panned down, pointing towards Elias who gazed up and saw Rae just a few floors above him. The other camera pointed towards a big red button, and the butler soon entered the frame. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;The girl? Or will you save the city? This button awakens my newest creations!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias hesitated, not knowing which option to choose. He knew he couldn&#39;t be the hero and perform both tasks; No, it was either Rae or the city. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Too late!&quot; the butler yelled. &quot;Cut it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A man swiftly cut the rope holding Rae up and she began falling. Then, the butler slammed the button hard with his fist. Elias didn&#39;t have a choice but to save Rae. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias gracefully caught Rae as she descended, falling and hitting hard on his arms. &quot;Oof! Are you alright?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Argh, I&#39;m fine...&quot; Rae groaned. Rae got on her feet again and Elias helped her out of the building.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A deafening whirring sound began to stir up as they stepped foot outside the Vroti Tower and what the two saw shocked them. The ground, the streets, and the land began to split in half and open into a giant enormous cave underneath them, unveiling a giant army of metal war robots.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Behold! The creations of the wisest civilisation, the Georgians! Bring me power, war robots!&quot; the butler shouted as he stood on the top floor of the Vroti tower. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Barton Colerico...&quot; Rae muttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s his name?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No wonder...That man has been America&#39;s most wanted for decades now...appearing on hundreds of headlines...&quot; Elias explained. &quot;He is a true mastermind...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Barton&#39;s laughter echoed through the tower, Rae&#39;s heart began to pound faster, matching the rhythm of the chaos surrounding her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The robots suddenly produced a deep and ominous grunt, shaking the very Earth and scaring the residents. The robots began hunting the residents like tiny ants, stomping on them and destroying nearby buildings; all but except the Vroti Tower.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae, we need to move!&quot; Elias&#39;s voice was strained, but she hesitated, glancing back at Barton. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Try to run! It will not be much longer until I gain control of the world!&quot; Barton roared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae gripped Elias&#39;s hand tightly, and together, they dashed for the exit as the ground trembled. Metal fragments sprayed past them, a relentless wave of heat and force. Rae stumbled, her chest heaving, each step pulling her farther from the only life she had ever known and closer to an uncertain future.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Aaah!&quot; Rae screamed as an arm flailed across her eyes. The war robots slowly awakened, their mechanical limbs creaking as they rose to infest the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;To the castle!&quot; Elias shouted as he found an empty car parked on the side. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Do you even know how to drive?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Relax! I got my licence 3 months ago!&quot; Surprisingly, no war robots attempted to get in Elias&#39;s way, and they casually made it to the castle without any incidents. The war robots acted as if there was a repellent on them, guiding them away from him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This is so strange...&quot; Elias remarked, looking back down at the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae! There you are!&quot; a voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Dad? You&#39;re awake?&quot; Rae stuttered, unable to piece her words together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s something I need to tell you. I always knew this day would come; I didn&#39;t expect it to arrive so soon. It&#39;s the end of the world...&quot; Rae&#39;s father began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What is it, Dad? Dad? Randall?&quot; Rae asked, now extremely eager.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;That&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m not your father. And I can&#39;t say if you are adopted or not...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae&#39;s heart suddenly skipped a beat. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Listen! After the fateful invasion in 1551, my family was tasked to guard and research the area. We&#39;ve been the guardians of this place. After discovering the war robots, we wanted to restore them to see what they could do. But none of us were capable. That&#39;s why, 19 years ago we asked mastermind Barton Colerico to help us fix these robots.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I get it!&quot; Elias interrupted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;He said it would cost a fortune to fix...&quot; Randall continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;And that&#39;s why Ajespa&#39;s merchants have such overpriced goods! They must all be working for Anateros!&quot; Elias realised.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Correct. For you Rae, Barton found you in a peculiar egg hidden away in the depths of the catacombs...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Dad...I...&quot; Rae began, panicking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Elias whispered, placing his hand on her shoulder, trying to calm her down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;He brought you here, and we took care of you. We didn&#39;t know what to do with you, so we just cared for you...Oh, now we left Barton in charge of the robots...We strayed too far, and he took control...How foolish I am...&quot; Randall sighed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re missing something...&quot; Elias hesitated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If Rae was found in the catacombs, and was in that egg thing...She has been alive for over 3 centuries...The Georgians were known for their wisdom, and after what I saw of the egg, it&#39;s like a cryonic device, allowing Rae to be transferred to the future...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Randall interrupted, now intrigued. He gazed into Elias&#39;s midnight black eyes, flawlessly deciphering the century-long mystery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m saying Rae is a descendant of the Georgians and could have the ability to control the robots. Think about it! Their wisdom rivals modern technology. Who knows if they have voice commands or something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae, try it! You must help us stop this madness Barton is doing!&quot; Randall begged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;The truth is, Rae is technically the queen of Georgia. If I&#39;m not wrong, the war robots were supposed to be designed as bodyguards that would protect her and free her from her century-long cryofreeze, but they were never finished. Instead, Barton had continued the Persian&#39;s work, freed Rae and altered the robots&#39; code.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ok...okay...&quot; Rae replied, catching her breath. Rae&#39;s heart hammered in her chest at a high tempo, with the echo of the beat seeming louder than the mechanical hum surrounding her. How were these machines supposed to be bodyguards? Rae felt the heavy weight of burdens the Georgians carried on her shoulders, as if her ancestors watched, waiting to see what the future queen would do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae looked down at her hands, then at Elias&#39;s eyes. Again, she saw only death in his eyes, but she knew that he had something special about him. Rae had never felt anything like this, and trusting in Elias was something hard for her to swallow. She quickly directed her attention back towards the robots and inhaled deeply, channelling her strength from a place she didn&#39;t know existed, and prepared to speak.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Stop!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To their surprise, there was a long delay, then silence. The city fell quiet, and the robots stopped the loud whirring noise and froze in motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What? What happened?&quot; Barton exclaimed in utter disbelief, leaning over the edge of the Vroti tower to see the chaos unfold. &quot;Why did they stop?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey Rae, what if you asked them to get Barton Colerico?&quot; Elias suggested, smiling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae blushed, nodded and went through with Elias&#39;s idea. Again, shouting at the top of her lungs, Rae commanded the robots. &quot;Get me Barton Colerico!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The robots scanned the area, finding Barton Colerico. The closest robot leaned down towards Barton and plucked him like a cherry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey! Let go of me! Argh!&quot; Barton squirmed. The machine marched towards Rae and threw him in front of her. This was a miraculous moment as peace and silence engulfed the whole city. Barton sprawled at Rae&#39;s feet, his expression twisting between anger and shock. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh...screw your royalty! I knew I shouldn&#39;t have freed you from that stupid egg...&quot; Barton whimpered as he struggled to get up, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re coming with me back to the States, buddy. You got a $500 million bounty on your head!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You think I&#39;m going down that easily?&quot; Barton laughed with his last breath. Then, like a cruel twist of fate, his hand slipped to his jacket, pulling out the small device as his lips curled into a smirk. &quot;You may have solved this case, but it will cost you your life...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There was a very subtle beeping sound at first, with Elias not even noticing. The sound gradually grew louder and louder until Rae heard it and pulled Elias towards her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A thunderous roar, hellish red fire and chunks of metal began spewing everywhere and one by one, the robots began to detonate, erupting and breaking apart. There was nothing but explosions. Rae, Elias, and Randall barely had time to dive for cover as the force of the explosions had sent large chunks of debris sky-high, piercing the ground as they came flying down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Larry! Bring down the chopper! Get me out of here!&quot; Barton yelled into his earpiece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias, Rae and Randall ran for cover as Barton ran towards the cliff&#39;s edge, swiftly jumping on the helicopter his men were piloting. &quot;We&#39;ll meet again, Elias!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias gave Barton a dirty look as he ran for cover. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The three quickly made their way to the manor&#39;s walls, estimating it was probably the safest place to take cover. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Suddenly, Elias&#39;s phone rang. Elias picked up the phone as he watched the city skyline crumble, each tower and building slowly disintegrating right in front of him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Novem, this is Sylvester from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division! I&#39;ve picked up some unusual activity near your location. Where on earth did Tom send you this time? Do you need a ride back? It looks like you are in a nuke zone now,&quot; the agent warned, his voice laced with urgency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, and please hurry up!&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yep! We have a speed jet on its way from Zestafoni that landed for a research project a couple of hours ago. It&#39;ll be there in about 5 minutes!&quot; the line hung up and Elias cleaned up his thoughts, thinking of what to do next.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;At least the city of lies is gone...&quot; Randall smiled as the city slowly crumbled, leaving only the ancient natural terrain behind. He leant against the brick wall of the manor, as a tear fell from his eyes. &quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes Dad, I love you...&quot; Rae cried, holding him tight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Rae darling...I think it&#39;s time you left the chains Vardzia and Georgia hold you...I know you aren&#39;t capable of this position, and I think everyone should learn the true history of the Georgians, here in Vardzia. It&#39;s time for you to explore the world. Who knows what you&#39;ll encounter?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Really?&quot; Rae sniffed. She couldn&#39;t hold her tears back anymore and started weeping, crying on her old man&#39;s shoulder. She looked into his eyes, the familiar kindness and strength that had always anchored her, and for a moment, the weight she carried faded. Randall smiled and kissed her on the forehead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, Barton has only been feeding you lies. The world now is so much better than it was 3 centuries ago. It&#39;s okay, I have always loved you,&quot; Randall smiled, his eyes softening. &quot;You were always destined for more, Rae. Vardzia may be your birthplace, but the world beyond awaits you. Go live it fully, for me, for your ancestors. Elias will help you; he seems like such a sweet boy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Randall!&quot; another voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Maria! Come on, hurry! You&#39;re going to die!&quot; Randall shouted. &quot;C&#39;mon, I promise we&#39;ll be here the next time you visit Rae. Your mother and I will always be here. Now go!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae glanced back one last time at the city skyline. She had been a victim of her legacy, but now she was free. With a final breath, she turned away from the city and stepped forward, embracing the world that waited beyond.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Let&#39;s go. The plane is here...We don&#39;t want to miss it...&quot; Elias motioned. Rae nodded, gave her father a final goodbye kiss, and then walked away. She followed closely with Elias, running towards the plane without looking back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I guess this is Ajespa&#39;s Acrimony...&quot; Randall laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;At least it&#39;s over and history is history,&quot; Maria added. The plane quickly took off and Rae was gone, with Elias to explore the world. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What do you want to do first?&quot; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know, you&#39;re the expert! You tell me!&quot; Rae laughed as she rested her head on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias looked out the window and took a sigh of relief, with the case finally being closed. He also knew that Barton and Anateros were far from being out of business.</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.js62dd2b429"><span class="c8">Roots of Airiman #3</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The static of his laptop quietly hummed in the background. Elias was once again, working tirelessly through the night on a report. He sat at his desk beside his dim lamp and was still tapping on the keys of his keyboard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The American Supernatural Intelligence Division was not lenient on any tasks. They had a strict and tight schedule, and Elias was not one of those members to stray from these rules. No, he was not anywhere near the top detectives in the division. He had only had a few encounters, and his last was nothing of a small feat, but rather a big one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He wanted to prove himself capable of taking on a higher position. Then, muffled footsteps echoed down the hallway outside, growing louder by the second. The door slowly creaked open. Through the small opening, a voice weakly whispered through. &quot;Why are you still up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Not now Rae...I&#39;m almost done...&quot; Elias replied as he stood up. Rae pushed the door open and entered Elias&#39;s room.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias, when are you going to go to bed...?&quot; Rae asked, rubbing her eyes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias sighed, leaning back. &quot;I can&#39;t rest until I&#39;ve finished writing this report. It&#39;s important, it&#39;s about your case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;My case...&quot; Rae began, playing with her lavender hair. She didn&#39;t know what to say, but it was important. Rae was unlike others, but her mystique was enchanting in a way that Elias couldn&#39;t deny. Although there was a much more complicated background, it was only Elias who was nice enough to accompany her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;ll only take about 5 more minutes...&quot; Elias reassured, with Rae watching eagerly at the screen as Elias typed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias...Just get some rest...Don&#39;t worry about it too much...&quot; Rae smiled. She leaned down a little and gave Elias a big cuddle. Elias took his hands off the keyboard and gently squeezed her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You have one new notification!&quot; a robotic voice alerted. Elias directed his sight back to the screen and opened his email inbox. At the very top, a new email appeared with the subject titled: &quot;Highly Classified&quot;. Elias opened the email and it read:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&#39;Dear Mr. Elias Novem,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Is this a good time? My name is Tristan Kniet, and I desperately need your help. Do you know of the Airiman&#39;s Essence?&#39;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence...&quot; Elias hesitated, then added, &quot;It&#39;s an old legend from the Indigenous tribes here. They spoke of a spirit-I can&#39;t remember what it is exactly. I just know that my professor said it was a way for the land to speak to those who don&#39;t belong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae shivered. &quot;And this random guy wants your help?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yep,&quot; Elias smiled, pushing away from Rae&#39;s embrace.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes, yes. Now can you go to bed?&quot; Rae said, impatiently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, night,&quot; Elias motioned, leading Rae out and kissing her. The morning sun soon rose and the sunlight gently submerged the living room with a warm, soft light. Rae was still sound asleep whilst Elias was again, up first making breakfast.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Morning Rae,&quot; Elias comforted, gently tapping Rae on her shoulder. &quot;Wake up!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ugh...What time is it?&quot; Rae groaned as she rubbed her eyes. &quot;How come you sleep so late and still be able to wake up so early?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;It&#39;s only 9:00 am, not even that early!&quot; Elias laughed, sitting down beside Rae, on her bed. &quot;My Professor is only free at 10:00 am so we better hurry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias and Rae soon arrived at the small, cosy apartment block on 81 Welster Street, where Elias&#39;s professor had resided. Elias stepped up to the grandeur-looking entrance on the third floor and knocked on the professor&#39;s door. There was no answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Maybe he&#39;s still asleep...&quot; Rae implied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias ignored her and knocked slightly harder. Slightly annoyed, Elias reached into his pockets, eventually finding two small keys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Which one do you think fits?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm? Neither matches the keyhole..?&quot; Rae asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re right, you need both keys...&quot; Elias demonstrated as he pieced together the keys in a specific way and gracefully unlocked the door, slowly pushing it open.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias carefully crossed the kitchen and approached his professor&#39;s study room, located on the far right side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Professor?&quot; Elias exclaimed, peeping his head inside. Instead of seeing the professor sitting upright at his desk, he was nowhere to be seen. It was a Saturday and normally, the professor would either be still asleep or at his desk working on lectures or marking papers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Instead of the presence of the professor, a curious-looking box sat sealed shut on his table. Elias carefully picked the box up and inspected it and found an engraving carved into the underside of the box.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Box of Dreams&quot; Elias read, putting it back down. His curiosity soon reached him and Elias couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. He wanted to open the box to see what was inside. He slid the lid off and the box was empty. Nothing was inside. Elias was confused. What had happened to his professor?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Looking for more answers, Elias found another box, assuming it was the packaging for the smaller wooden box that had mysteriously killed the professor. On it read an address, from the Northern Territory of Australia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Fuck this, I&#39;m not getting paid enough...&quot; Elias sighed as he stormed outside and booked a plane ticket. Rae heard Elias march out and quickly followed behind, racing down the stairs outside the building.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I need to go to Australia. I&#39;ll be back in a week.&quot; Elias explained. &quot;Look after yourself...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias held a worried look and quickly jumped into his car and drove off to the airport.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey wait a minute! You can&#39;t just leave me here!&quot; Rae yelled, but it was no use. Elias had sped off as if he was more concerned about his professor and not Rae.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae was furious, but it didn&#39;t tangle her logic as her mind remained rational and calm. Rae quickly made her way back home then packed some necessities and headed towards the airport, buying a ticket herself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Australian air clung thick and hot. It was warmer than Elias and Rae had both thought, reaching up to temperatures of 32&#8304;C. The airport had a fresh minty aroma that made the surrounding barren desert feel modern and crispier. Elias squinted into the sun as he stepped out into the desolate terrain, feeling a sense of displacement as if the land was vibrating beneath his feat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias soon arrived at the location, a remote town nearing the centre of Australia. He checked in at a nearby hotel. The hotel was simple and old, to say the least, for it to look abandoned in the small town located in the empty desert was nothing new.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae on the other hand was behind, approximately by 8 hours or so. Rae found her way into Australia the next morning, in search of Elias. She didn&#39;t have any information on where he had gone, and she knew that this was also her mission to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Soon, Rae found a local hotel near Darwin. She knew she wanted to have some fun and explore what the isolated city of Darwin had to offer before she began her proper quest to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-&laquo; Day 1: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias woke to the radio&#39;s dull chatter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; The voice droned on, static crackling slightly, an odd hiccup in the broadcast. He rolled his eyes, annoyed by the noise and turned it off without a second thought. Elias decided to explore the hotel and wandered into the mess of a dining hall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias...Elias...&quot; a voice rang as Elias ate his food.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias jerked around, looking around to find nobody. Then there was the tingling sensation that sent chills down Elias&#39;s spine as Elias for once in his life, felt afraid, and that someone was there to hunt him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias quickly finished his meal and left the hotel, heading out to the site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t remember me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Um, ok? I mean, my name is Tristan Kniet after all. I guess you&#39;re only trying to help me...Unless you can solve this stupid mystery, you can&#39;t kindly leave me be,&quot; Tristan explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What&#39;s the mystery?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, that...&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What about it?&quot; Elias questioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, every day they appear and surround the town.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Then how did I get here at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know. They would stop at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes? And? What are you implying?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I don&#39;t know how to get out...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Get out of what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;This town! I arrived last week, and ever since then, I&#39;ve been stuck here! I&#39;ve been paying absurd amounts of money to the hotel!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, can&#39;t you just make a call or something?&quot; Elias suggested, taking his phone out. As he tried to open his networking app, a red alert displayed the two words that shook Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;NO SIGNAL&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh. How did you send that email of yours though?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Like I said, I haven&#39;t sent an email!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;If you&#39;re gonna be like that, I&#39;m just going to leave,&quot; Elias replied, now frustrated again. He couldn&#39;t believe a client who emailed him didn&#39;t even know that he emailed him. As he walked through the town, he witnessed a man getting hit by a ball that some kids were playing with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Elias tried to navigate through the dust storms, he could barely see and was forced to turn back. Still, Elias was determined to leave the town. He waited until the storms had calmed down. During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange that burnt the sandy terrain. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias ventured to the outskirts of the town. It was cold and dark outside, making this task quite difficult. Elias didn&#39;t give in though, for he explored quite far before he saw it. It wasn&#39;t a mere hallucination but strange beasts suddenly started to creep out from the bushes and startled Elias. He had never seen animals this large that loomed over him like towers. He felt vulnerable and was terrified. He had never seen anything like this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Those are megafauna, kid. That&#39;s the Diprotodon in front of you...&quot; a man laughed. Elias didn&#39;t find it funny.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You can see it?&quot; Elias screamed</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Obviously!&quot; the man laughed again. &quot;I&#39;d advise you to stay in this town. There are quite some scary monsters out there!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Elias screamed again. He suddenly realised why Kniet did not know how to escape. The town was cursed, somehow. Elias quickly made his way back into his room and passed the night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; the other broadcaster suddenly stuttered, as if the radio had glitched some sort. &quot;-we&#39;ll be continuing with dust storms in the afternoon,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias, frustrated, got up and turned the radio off. He was in a bad mood, and the radio only worsened it. It was like the radio was emitting deafening sound waves into his mind, vibrating so heavily that it gave him a headache.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it. However, as Elias was eating the food, he felt like he had eaten this type of food before, even though he had never been to Australia, nor had he had any authentic Australian experiences back in the States like this. Something felt off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After Elias finished his meal, he felt a sense of deja vu, but nothing clicked in his head. The subtle feeling kicked his mind awake, but yet he could not recall anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias Novem&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;That name rings a bell...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Um, ok?

Elias laughed again with the man as if it felt natural. But it didn&#39;t feel normal. Each day felt so surreal as if it was repeating. Was he in Groundhog Day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The quiet radio static turned into a deafening machine, alerting Elias out of his sleep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The broadcaster&#39;s voice sounded bizarrely similar, with the same sarcastic tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; the voice announced as if it were reading off a script. Elias froze. A cold unease settled in his chest. Elias didn&#39;t think again and threw the radio against the wall; he was frustrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias wasn&#39;t hungry so he skipped breakfast. Instead, he headed immediately towards the site.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Kniet? Are you trying to get out this time of day, again?&quot; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;My name is Elias Novem. I was tasked by someone to help you...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Great! So, how do we get rid of that thing?&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; Elias explained. Elias&#39;s muscle memory had somehow kicked in and had overrode his actions. Elias was spitting everything out to his instinct&#39;s desire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange, again. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended. Elias this time was aware and his body controlled his navigation systems, rerouting him to venture to a darker part of the town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hmm...&quot; a man mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias began. He crossed his arms and sternly looked at the man who was sitting on the wooden crates, holding a strange device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Very well. But this isn&#39;t the solution you&#39;re looking for...&quot; the man hissed, with his words almost being inaudible. Elias flinched then he saw darkness. The man had knocked Elias out cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; Elias jumped out of his bed and threw the radio across the room, annoyed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The day felt repeated, with Elias remembering some things he did. But he knew something now. Before he left the hotel, Elias quickly snuck a pen and notepad into his jacket.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Throughout the day, Elias jotted everything down, allowing him to remember clearly. He knew something was odd about his thoughts and knew his logic was clouded by some strange unknown force. He wanted to test a theory as he knew there was something strange.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias again, found himself nearing the alleyway again that evening, passing by the same man he encountered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Standing a safe distance, Elias sketched out the strange device the man held and quickly tucked his notepad back into his jacket. The man was unfazed and did not notice Elias&#39;s presence. He sat there, using the device like a cigarette.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He quickly escaped the scene, going back to his hotel room and calling it a night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">-&laquo; Day 5: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias was once again startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, Elias didn&#39;t even wait. Before the announcer could say a word, Elias had hurled the radio across the room, smashing it against the wall. &#39;Shut up!&#39; he yelled, gasping as the eerie sensation of deja vu washed over him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Elias put his jacket on, a piece of paper cut that was placed inside his jacket slipped out. What was this? Elias had never seen this paper before. He picked it up in confusion and saw impossible-looking sketches. Then, he found a notepad lodged in the other pocket of his jacket. When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It seemed to Elias to be some kind of map. Elias went to the marked spot at 17:30 and found it to be empty. However, just as Elias was about to leave, a man walked by.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Huh? How did you get here?!&quot; the man exclaimed. The man was in terror and fell backwards, dropping a strange device. Elias quickly peeked at the notepad and realised the device looked strangely similar to the object sketched. Elias dove for the device and snatched it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No!&quot; the man yelled. His voice grew in anger as he jumped towards Elias, trying to take the device back. Elias quickly dodged the man attempting to attack him and safely stood up with the device in his hands. &quot;You mustn&#39;t use it! You will die!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Me? Die?&quot; Elias questioned. He had felt like he had died multiple times now, reliving the same day. Elias toyed around with the device and suddenly started it. It began shooting out a strange yellow gas that quickly spread around. He didn&#39;t know how to stop it, but it began to grow larger and larger, spreading throughout the town. Elias inhaled the gas, taking a big breath in. It was a dangerous move, but he knew something about this device was letting this mysterious man remember and not be affected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You idiot!&quot; the man yelled. He jumped up and attacked Elias. Again, Elias swiftly dodged his attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Stop lying. I think I know what&#39;s up now,&quot; Elias explained. The man froze in motion, eyes widening in terror. &quot;My memories...Or should I say the town&#39;s memories? They are getting reset each night...Time still moves normally, it&#39;s just our memories are wiped so our minds think we haven&#39;t moved forward&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;And? Your current memories will just reset tomorrow morning! You can&#39;t do anything!&quot; the man laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Really, Tristan Kniet? You think that this is going to work?&quot; Elias mumbled. &quot;I know this town well enough now. You used the only computer in this town to send that email and pretended to lose your memories. That device you dropped, kills this drug. I remember clearly now. It all makes sense.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;No, this can&#39;t be!&quot; Tristan exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Firstly, the megafauna are all just mere illusions. They are centuries old and they cannot possibly come back to life. Secondly, you said to me to help get rid of those dust storms. How can one stop a dust storm? There are so many more flaws that give this hoax away. You are riddled with chaos...&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I-&quot; Tristan croaked. &quot;Maybe...Just maybe I needed you to help free me from my madness. I discovered this drug and I almost died...and I wanted to show the world...but this cycle...the antidote...the money...it all sounded too good...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I&#39;m betting you, Anateros is behind this, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Elias laughed. Tristan suddenly fell to his knees, gasping for air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;How... how did you know?&quot; Tristan choked. The air grew thin for Tristan, and without the antidote, the drug quickly seeped through the ground into his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His smile faded from a sinister grin and slowly formed an expression of despair, begging for the antidote. &quot;They tricked me! Please...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias frowned, his grip tightening on the antidote. &quot;You&#39;re pathetic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tristan let out a weak laugh, his voice hollow. &quot;They paid me so much...to lure you...to get rid of you...But it didn&#39;t work out...Our plans were rushed...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias threw the device and it shattered into pieces, the antidote scattering everywhere. The gas slowly sifted into the ground, destroying some of the drug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You&#39;re an archaeologist. Enlighten me.&quot; Elias ordered. &quot;This drug needs to be exterminated, and investigated further,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias helped Tristan stand up, knowing that his motives were purely driven by Anateros&#39;s corrupt organisation, manipulating his actions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, I admit defeat. You&#39;ve bested me, Novem. This town once was the Airiman&#39;s villa, an Indigenous Tribe. They found these strange roots in South Australia and brought them up north to plant. What they didn&#39;t know was that it was actually a deadly drug that when planted in the wrong conditions, has severe aftereffects. We&#39;ve all experienced it. Hallucinations and memory loss.&quot; Tristan explained. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have more of the antidote,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;How do I get out of here?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Go, leave. Leave me alone in this town now,&quot; Tristan mumbled as he handed Elias a pair of keys and a capsule filled with the antidote. &quot;Use the antidote like a cigarette...One puff will last around 2 hours. Good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;I have one more question,&quot; Elias smiled, his midnight black eyes widening. The look of death stared Tristan down, sending a terrifying chill down his spine that shook his entire body. &quot;How much work did you go into buying new radios and repairing the wall every night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Tristan was in denial. How had he messed it up so badly? Then, Tristan remembered. His memories began to appear clearer than ever before, recalling back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;They were Anateros men. Two remained here, always, with protective gear. Go now before they come looking for me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This time, Elias was surprised, with his mouth hanging open. Anateros had not only been manipulating Tristan, but it was their discovery. Elias turned around and ran towards the old car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Elias got a signal, he checked his phone. 10 missed calls from Rae. 64 missed calls from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. He had messed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Back in Darwin, Rae had spent the past two weeks living off of Elias&#39;s credit card. Elias had completely lost track of time. He had spent countless days putting everything together and when he checked his balance, he was $10,000 in debt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae was quite literally having some of the best time in her life, being free and exploring new places. In just two weeks, she had bought various expensive clothes, tasted numerous mouth-watering foods and enjoyed many fun activities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But it was all about to end. Her phone rang at 23:00 sharp and her eyes lit up with joy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Elias?&quot; Rae said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Hi Rae...What the fuck have you done?&quot; Elias replied, angry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;What...?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;$10,000 in debt?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Oh, oops...&quot; Rae giggled, holding back her tears. &quot;I missed you, Elias, it&#39;s nice to hear your voice again. I bought you gifts!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;How are we meant to get back?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Um...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You sometimes are so cheeky...&quot; Elias sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll call Sylvester to see what he can do...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias soon caught up with Rae at the hotel she was staying at. Elias apologised for running off without her and Rae was just glad to see Elias alive and back to normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Alright, let&#39;s go home,&quot; Elias said as he rang the ASID&#39;s emergency contact number. He was tired and didn&#39;t want to file this as a case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Sylvester&#39;s voice squeaked over the subtle phone static as he picked up. &quot;Hello? Who&#39;s this?&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Sylvester, it&#39;s me. I&#39;ve been away...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t Novem...&quot; Sylvester laughed. &quot;Welcome back to life, kid. Our systems couldn&#39;t locate or reach you for 2 weeks and some speculated you were dead. Of course, I know you don&#39;t go down with a fight. What have you been up to?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;Well, Sylvester, if you could be the protagonist in Groundhog Day while getting your memories wiped every day, would you want to be the protagonist?&quot; Elias asked. Sylvester was intrigued and leaned forward in his chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&quot;You see Elias, this is a strange world. I would love to.&quot; Sylvester replied, laughing softly. &quot;All I can say is you might have just solved the case of the Lost Southern Drug. Congrats kid.&quot;</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.xa6gh12ah306"><span class="c8">The Jespan&rsquo;s Star #4</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;So Novem&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great asset. You&rsquo;ve been outperforming these amateurs&hellip;&rdquo; His expression grew, his face still turned to Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Mr Ozim,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;These supernatural occurrences&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mastermind behind the ASID, you don&rsquo;t need to worry. I&rsquo;ve linked these cases&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton explained as he shifted towards the whiteboard. The clinical meeting room enveloped a bitter tone, biting at Elias&rsquo;s skin. The whiteboard marker popped, scribbling following, scratching Elias&rsquo;s eardrums.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jaxton sketched a quick diagram, displaying Ajespa. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No royals or anything is linked to Georgia and Rae&hellip;My research tells me Rae isn&rsquo;t human. She&rsquo;s from another world&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton sighed and placed his hand on Elias&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take care of her, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course&hellip;&rdquo; Elias stuttered, his voice suddenly shaking at this realisation. Elias had been so enchanted by her personality that he didn&rsquo;t notice the flaws of Rae. Her perfect English with no accent and her unique physique. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The whiteboard stood menacingly back against the room, the contents on the board ever so terrifying. The words &ldquo;princess&rdquo; and a rough sketch of a UFO haunted Elias, confusing and worrying him. Just who was Rae? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take this too seriously though kid, you&rsquo;ve made a name for yourself in the world, just take a look!&rdquo; Jaxton smiled, reaching for the remote that turned the small TV screen that hovered in the corner of the room. Though small, it was large enough to clearly show the headline of the news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Good afternoon Indiana, this is Skie Leanne of WXIN, today bringing an international news case! Government officials across the world have correctly identified an unknown flying machine entering the airspace of Georgia, landing in Vardzia. We don&rsquo;t know who or what they are and why they are here. Stay tuned for more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You see Novem, this is a case that you should look forward to. Why don&rsquo;t you put that anthropology degree of yours to use? Eh, Novem? Huh?&rdquo; said Jaxton. Elias was gone already. &ldquo;Tch, that kid&hellip;Get my jet ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias rushed into the hallway and frantically dialled Rae&rsquo;s number. The numbers felt like frozen buttons, each tap sending a terrible chilling sensation. What was this occurrence?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Such a coincidence, Jaxton mentioning Rae was extra-terrestrial and now spaceships landing in Vardzia. It was real, but Elias kept trying to deny it. He believed that the spaceship was an illusion, rather another scheme plotted by Anateros.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rae! Did you hear the news?&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elias, I was about to call you!&rdquo; Rae&rsquo;s voice echoed. The speakers blasted slowly, reverberating. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Stay there&hellip;&rdquo; Elias reassured, his voice calming down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elias, are you taking this job or not?&rdquo; Jaxton&rsquo;s voice lingered down the hallway, Elias finally locking eyes with Jaxton. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Let me get Rae first,&rdquo; Elias reassured, giving Jaxton the green light to wait for him. Elias and Rae soon met Jaxton on the pitched runway where he parked his private jet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Shall we get in the air?&rdquo; Jaxton proposed, motioning for the two to enter. The interior was luxurious to say the least, with fancy cocktails and food. They flew as quickly as they could towards Vardzia, unbeknownst to them would lie the greatest case in history. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As Elias and Rae ventured back into Vardzia, observing the large spaceship that landed in the mountains. Again, it seemed futuristic enough to resemble the now non-existent city of Ajespa, also matching the overall aesthetics they employed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Out of nowhere, a battalion of troops emerged, alienlike. Of course they weren&#39;t human, but neither were they aliens. They were robots. They looked identical to those monsters they fought back in Old Ajespa, but scaled down by a lot. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The machines beeped. The static buzz tuned up into a deafening frequency, paralysing Elias. Rae stood unfazed, Elias struggling. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;JESPAN DETECTED. ANALYZING IDENTITY: HELLO PRINCESS MALVORR.&rdquo; The robots emitted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey! What are you&ndash; Aaah!&rdquo; Rae squealed. The robots definitely weren&#39;t kind, swiftly dragging Rae and Elias back into the ship. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Princess?&rdquo; crewmates chirped as Rae landed on the ship, walking towards the starboard. Though she had never been on a ship like this before, it felt like she had. A mystical sense of deja vu gushed down on her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Chain him up!&rdquo; the others chanted, the robots still carrying the paralysed Elias. On the east side, the robots held Elias against the wall and stripped his shirt, then chaining him onto place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The metal straps tightly held Elias in place, as if he was crucified. The metallic surface was cold, his weak body leaning forward in despair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You! Stay away from the princess of Ajespa!&rdquo; a voice rang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey! Let him go!&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice echoed. It felt like two sides were fighting for him, one to torture him further and the other to save him. But it was Rae against the whole crew. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rae, do you forget who we are?&rdquo; a new voice crackled. Elias&#39;s eyes finally opened slowly, scanning the perimeter. He saw humanoid like people, of course he knew they weren&#39;t humans as they hovered like superheroes from a fictional world. Their appearance indeed mimicked humans almost perfectly and from what Elias could hear, their personalities were robust. &ldquo;We came to Earth not to find love, we came for the Orichalcum&hellip;We came back now again&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice suddenly grew weak and her expression went pale. His majesty&#39;s ominous aura flooded the starboard, his voice deep and hypnotic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;KILL HIM.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The crew beat Elias, blood spewing everywhere. It was brutal and Rae couldn&#39;t bear to watch. The beating turned into a show, with several crewmates throwing objects at him and making a mockery out of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;WAIT.&rdquo; His majesty ordered. &ldquo;STOP.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The crew listened and pulled back, with Elias barely breathing. It was obvious the crew was not good at killing, with their puny attempts to damage him failing, with all his vital organs and bones still intact. All that they had done was give Elias the rotten impression that this race was corrupt.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;As the Jespan&rsquo;s race&#39;s ruler, I inquire what has brought you here?&rdquo; His majesty&#39;s deep magenta beard brushed against Elias&#39;s hair as he towered above him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias, trying to piece together his words, was barely able to speak. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;Rae&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae suddenly snapped into a state, even herself being unaware of it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The static hum pierced Rae&#39;s mind, suddenly recalling the nothingness of a room in the spaceship. Was she hallucinating? No, it was more than just a hallucination. It was a message, a vision. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The voice, it was of her real mother. Her voice whispered silently in her mind. The memories churned, her anger dissipated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This star is the last of our race! The protectors who have adorned them, and yet, you don&#39;t wish for us to survive?&rdquo; her mother echoed. The ethereal flashback she experienced felt unreal, she knew she had never been in that position where she witnessed her parents arguing. Perhaps it was before her birth? It couldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;These protectors are useless, they fall out of the sky, one by one! They are worth nothing if the Avidrones can kill them so easily!&rdquo; her father yelled. His voice hadn&#39;t changed, that stubborn, egotistical old man of a father she had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Please Kareth&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No Halena, it must be done,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This world is no place for our child! That Orichalcum rich planet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You mean that planet Earth? Tch, to hell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Her mind raced. She knew her real father, Kareth, was no one to believe in heroes. She assumed he had no knowledge of the Orichalcum star.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">She took out the pendant that she had treasured. Though hazy, she could still vividly remember this pendant came with her arrival on Earth. Perhaps it was a sign? Maybe it was the Orichalcum star?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rae! Focus on this!&rdquo; His majesty threatened. &ldquo;Is that an Orichalcum star?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Um&hellip;yes? Can I give it to him&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae asked, not knowing what it did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What? Give him&hellip;the Orichalcum star?&rdquo; His majesty laughed. Rae, frustrated, shoved the small star shaped crystal deep into Elias&#39;s body, penetrating his skin and ripping apart his flesh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Aaargh!&rdquo; Elias screamed in pain. The star bled into his blood, a deep violet glow radiated from his skin. His vision grew hazy, and particles began to appear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&#39;m so sorry! Please, save yourself&hellip;&rdquo; Rae wept as the crew forcefully pulled her away from Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You stupid girl! Our Orichalcum star is gone now!&rdquo; His majesty roared. &ldquo;TAKE HER AWAY. AND ACTUALLY KILL THE GUY FOR REAL THIS TIME.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The crew dragged Rae away and the rest focused on killing Elias. There was no hope. Punch after punch, the crew gasped for breath, growing ever so tired, hurting Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Man, I never thought killing somebody with your fist was hard&hellip;&rdquo; a crewmate mumbled. The particles appeared again. They emerged from the bodies. The flake-like shape particles slowly drifted towards Elias. He slowly breathed them in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do ya think Malvorr would say this is good enough?&rdquo; another crewmate huffed. All out of breath, Elias&#39;s breathing picked up in pace, his veins glowing brighter each second in a menacing purple. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey hey hey now! You can&#39;t call his majesty Malvorr! If you get caught we&#39;ll be executed!&rdquo; another remarked. &ldquo;Remember his Orichalcum star infused blade? The Starslayer&hellip;It destroyed our planet&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;what&#39;s happening to him?&rdquo; Another added, his attention turning back to Elias. The crew gathered around, puzzled by Elias&#39;s state. A large outburst suddenly propelled the chains that confined Elias back, followed by a humongous purple supernova-like explosion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Majority of the crew were knocked out instantly, crashing into the hard metallic walls. Shattered glass and steel shards vibrated on the ground, piercing the air that was once warm. The room was clinically cold.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae, who was interrogated by her real father, suddenly heard the loud, painful sounds of crewmates falling. The conversation was interrupted and King Malvorr was angry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rae. You have been blinded. I, Kareth Malvorr, your real father will show you the true world,&rdquo; King Malvorr mumbled, reaching for the Starslayer. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The blade was slick, a golden handle with grey engravings of his name &ldquo;Malvorr&rdquo; glistened underneath the warm lights the haven provided. As he stepped out into the hallways, his blade scraped the ground, a painful sound complimented by the slow, purple pulsing the core of the sword emitted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Rae Malvorr, my dearest daughter&hellip;How have you come to like these humans?&rdquo; King Malvorr grumbled, his expression growing even angrier, his voice carrying a heavy sense of frustration. No, he didn&#39;t only feel betrayed by her daughter, he was disappointed. &ldquo;Helena, you don&#39;t know what you have started&hellip;That mission&hellip;you lied to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">King Malvorr&#39;s grim frown was permanent, his past was too traumatic. Him and Helena were never on good terms. But the mission? That was different. He had thought Helena had left Rae on Earth to command, build an army to mine Orichalcum for their race but this? To fall in love with a human? It was sickening. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kareth Malvorr I presume&hellip;?&rdquo; Elias smiled, all energetic. His energy was restored, taking on a fancy suit of armor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed, frustrated. &ldquo;Senturies! Go!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A swarm of small, dwarf-like machines flew out from a hatch, attacking Elias. His vision grew clear, more energy particles releasing from every movement of the drones. No, it wasn&#39;t that the machines were getting tired, rather it was the excess or waste energy they produced. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Elias gasped, coming to his senses. He could see his true power, his true potential, to manipulate wasted energy into something strong. &ldquo;Implode!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His voice channelled through the ship, followed by a chain of small explosions that blew up the swarms of Senturies. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; King Malvorr exclaimed. &ldquo;That&#39;s it&hellip;Feel the wrath of my Starslayer!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The heavy blade clashed against Elias&#39;s sturdy forearms, able to resist and absorb all damage. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This&hellip;feels&hellip;amazing!&rdquo; Elias chuckled. A clump of particles drifted towards Elias where he formed a sword of himself. &ldquo;I have no clue how this works&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A bright, periwinkle sword manifested from energy appeared in Elias&#39;s hands, radiating ethereal like waves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This&hellip;can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed. Elias rushed in, striking Malvorr. Malvorr fought back heroically, but unable to keep up with the flurry of attacks Elias was producing. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Striking the ground with his Starslayer, the sword drew out a massive outburst of energy, sucking the energy from Elias leaving him weak and fragile. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Now&hellip;DIE.&rdquo; Malvorr growled, his sword pulsing faster and faster. Elias couldn&#39;t move, he was deprived of energy and moreover, his face was covered in blood. The crimson red liquid dripped slowly to the ground, each drop vibrating as the heavy steps of Malvorr drew closer. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Malvorr struggled to lift the sword as it was heavy from all the energy it stored, needing him to exert extra energy into it. As he huffed and puffed ready to execute Elias, his breath slowly slipped into Elias, giving him just enough energy to create a small shard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Orichalcum Star was rotating fast in the sword&#39;s hilt, and as the sword came down, Elias smirked, rolling away and stabbing the overflowing star into oblivion. It exploded, leaving an overwhelming force that instantly broke the star and knocked both Elias and Malvorr away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Please wake up&hellip;&rdquo; Rae cried. Elias was weak, the explosion injuring him heavily. His eyes ever so slightly opened, giving Rae a sense of hope. She sighed a happy sigh of relief. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;no&hellip; This can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr shouted, as if he wasn&#39;t impacted by the explosion. &ldquo;You ruined my sword! Leave me, and for you Rae, I&#39;m disgusted. I&#39;m leaving you here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Surprisingly, the ship was still intact, no major damage except for the breached doors and crushed machinery. Malvorr rushed to the deck and shifted gears. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You can&#39;t leave us!&rdquo; Rae exclaimed, demanding for a proper answer. Malvorr, defeated, threw a furious look then chucked a sphere-like object at them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Knock yourselves out.&rdquo; said Malvorr, gritting his teeth. He slammed the button that opened the hatch, dropping both Rae and Elias back outside, in Vardzia. The ship took off quickly, soaring into space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Are you alright?&rdquo; Rae asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Elias chuckled. Rae toyed around with the sphere, appearing to be a projector of some sort. Then, a hologram appeared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dear Rae, if you&#39;re watching this, this means our race is almost extinct. The Avidrones have conquered our planet and I was the one who left you on Earth. I wanted you to be safe, away from warfare. This also means that you have the last Orichalcum Star. They are powerful items that can unleash astronomical powers. These superpowers once created strong and reliant protectors, but now it&#39;s your choice to help save our race. Choose your hero that will protect us.&rdquo; The hologram was of Helena Malvorr, her real mother. It felt surreal seeing her mother for the first time. &ldquo;Also, you might find yourself adapting to life on Earth quite easily. Us Jespans have a few quirks, having incredible memory, being multilingual and being able to short fly. Good luck, dear.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jaxton&#39;s voice echoed from afar, calling out their names. Elias and Rae sat in peace. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Dear lord, what happened to you two? I saw a bunch of robots kidnapping you guys, and now you&#39;re almost dead!&rdquo; Jaxton sighed. &ldquo;Thank god we didn&#39;t lose Elias,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Rae sniffed, holding back her tears for what she had experienced. Were the Jespans really that bad? And what&#39;s next? Did Anateros know about their existence already? It was all a big mystery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Are you all okay?&rdquo; Jaxton reassured, helping Elias up back into the Jet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;He will be fine&hellip;He&#39;s a hero&hellip;&rdquo; Rae whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Of course, he&#39;s my best,&rdquo; Jaxton boasted. Rae shook her head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;No, I mean like a superhero,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Kid&#39;s got superpowers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes. It&#39;s a long story. I&#39;ll tell you the story later. It&#39;s what my race, the Jespans, call the Jespan Star.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c7" id="h.7q2br3uu5wki"><span class="c8">The Ozim Files </span></h3><h4 class="c11" id="h.u3povvwzrevd"><span class="c6">#5</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Elias scrolled through his computer, bored. It was another weekday night, with no cases left. His door opened. Rae entered shyly, watching the dull screen Elias stared into. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Rae smiled. &ldquo;Whatchu up to?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just bored&hellip;&rdquo; Elias groaned, giving Rae a grim expression.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Speaking of nothing to do, Jaxton gave me this USB stick when we were discussing more about the Jespans yesterday&hellip;&rdquo; Rae explained, handing him a USB with the letters OZIM engraved onto it. Elias was confused, starstruck at how Rae had gotten into a discussion with Jaxton in the first place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What do you expect me to do, open it?&rdquo; Elias laughed. Rae snatched the USB back and plugged it into his laptop. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His screen flashed, then his file explorer opened. There laid 4 different PDFs, each titled &ldquo;Ozim File.pdf&rdquo;. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wanna have a read?&rdquo; Rae asked as she pulled up a chair, sitting curiously beside Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Alright, I guess so&hellip;&rdquo; And so, the case began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You may be wondering who I am and why I am writing all my cases up into detailed analysis. My name is Jaxton Ozim and founder of the American Supernatural Intelligence Division in Indianapolis, Indiana. I was a veteran in the US Military, Navy and Airforce, an extremely dominant and useful asset in battle. I devoted my time after retiring 2 years ago to start up this company after we found cosmic disparities hovering about near the gulf of Argentina and Antarctica. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Topic: Cosmic Disparities</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Case ID: 001</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reporter: Dr. Alastair Davis</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Entity No: 001</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Atlantic Ocean, Deception Island</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 3 April 2001</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The helicopter blades cut through the bitter air as I approached Deception Island. My pilot expertly navigated the treacherous winds, bringing us down on a relatively flat area of the island. The landing wasn&#39;t smooth, the skids crunching through what appeared to be recently fractured ice. The pattern of breakage immediately caught my attention &ndash; not consistent with natural formations.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Back in a few hours,&rdquo; were the last words I heard him say before I saw something that I shouldn&rsquo;t have seen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I nodded unknowingly of what was to come, watching the helicopter disappear into the gray sky. Climbing up to the peak was challenging enough, the path was blurred and the terrain was uneven. The ice had masked fragments of debris.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then, I felt the tremors. They began approximately 3 quarters of the way up, acting as a warning for me to not venture too deep. No, they weren&#39;t violent, but definitely cautionary now that I think back to it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I paused, checking my specialised equipment. The reading was unlike anything we&#39;d theorised in our initial research&mdash;not the typical signature of volcanic activity, but something more rhythmic, almost like a pulse.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The crater rim finally came into view after another hour of cautious climbing. I gazed down into the volcano from the edge, inspecting the condition. And to no surprise, there was indeed something supernatural that laid eagerly in the center. It radiated such an immense aura. There, embedded in the dark volcanic rock, was a crystalline formation unlike anything I&#39;d ever encountered during my military or scientific career&mdash;a massive purple crystal, approximately 5 feet in height, pulsing with an inner light that matched the rhythm of the tremors I&#39;d been feeling.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">As I documented the anomaly with our specialised cameras, I felt a strange sensation&mdash;a pull, not physical but mental, drawing me toward the crystal. I tried to fight, but it pulled me into the void. Then, it was darkness. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I awoke to warmth and the sound of distant voices. My eyes fluttered open to brilliant sunshine and a sapphire sky. It was impossible for the Antarctic latitudes, but it felt so real. I stood up and followed the marble pathway that I had fallen onto, leading to an enormous golden gate. There it was, the city of white stone and gold stretched toward the horizon, surrounded by sparkling blue waters.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;Atlantis,&quot; my analytical mind supplied, even as I rejected the impossibility. This was clearly some form of induced psychotropic state. Yet the warm breeze felt real against my skin. The golden gates swung open as I approached, and I found myself walking through streets bustling with activity. Atlantians, perhaps. I saw people dressed in flowing garments, their actions precise. Everything felt flawless, with the magnificent gardens and intricate mechanisms all about the city. Though their gazes weren&rsquo;t bright, they held a solemn expression devoid of joy or wonder. They were disciplined.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">His voice boomed behind me, of course it was none other than the king himself, Atlas. I was shook at the moment, but his tall figure adorned in purple and gold appeared friendly and gave me a hand. His face was handsome but severe, his bearing regal and imposing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;I am Atlas, king of Atlantis. Make yourself home&quot; he announced.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;This isn&#39;t real,&quot; I said firmly. I was at this point that this was in fact, the cosmic disparity Dr Alastair David had reported. A transfer to an alternate dimension. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Atlas laughed, the sound echoing unnaturally. &quot;Real? What is reality but perception, Jaxton Ozim? Come, let me show you the glory of true civilization.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">For what seemed like hours, Atlas guided me through his kingdom. He showed me temples of astronomical precision, libraries containing knowledge lost to the surface world, and technologies that defied my understanding. All the while, he boasted of the perfection of his creation.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;We have eliminated disease, hunger, and conflict,&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;Perfect order, perfect harmony.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Though, I begged to differ as I observed the robotic precision the citizens had, never speaking unless spoken to, never meeting each other&#39;s eyes. When Atlas approached, they prostrated themselves in terror rather than reverence. So as the man I was, I argued for joy and freedom for the people.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Atlas&#39;s face darkened. &quot;What use is joy when it leads to chaos? What value has freedom when it breeds conflict?&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as a perfect world,&quot; I argued. I remembered, the history books had emphasised Atlas&rsquo;s greed and arrogance that lead to Atlantis&rsquo;s downfall. Perhaps I could escape this way.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Atlas&#39;s eyes flashed with rage. He raised his trident, its points glowing with energy. He struck me, missing and hit the marble floor with a thunderous crack. Energy pulsed outward, shaking the foundations of the great hall. Another strike. I dove aside as a column crashed down where I had stood, my combat instincts taking over. All around us, the flawless city began to fracture, golden spires toppling as fissures spread through the immaculate streets. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The perfect world of Atlantis was falling, sinking beneath the waves it had risen from. Atlas&#39;s anguished scream was the last thing I heard before darkness took me again.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I gasped awake, flat on my back at the edge of the volcano&#39;s caldera. The air was bitterly cold again, the sky the familiar gray of Antarctic twilight. My watch showed that only twenty minutes had passed since I&#39;d reached the crater&#39;s edge.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Shakily, I rose to my feet and looked down into the crater. The crystal was still there, but the brilliant purple glow had faded to a dull, unremarkable hue. Whatever power it had possessed&mdash;or I had experienced&mdash;was now dormant.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">As the helicopter appeared on the horizon, I made my decision. This would be classified as Entity #001, the first confirmed supernatural phenomenon in our organisation&#39;s catalog. The connection to Atlantis and the apparent interdimensional properties of the crystal would require further study.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&gt;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reporter: Dr. Emmanuel Sies</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Entity No: 002</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Manhattan, New York</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 11 September 2001</span></p><p class="c4"><span>A tragic day. Some are already calling this the greatest terrorist attack in American history, but having witnessed what I did, I understand it to be something far more sinister. I was in Manhattan when it happened, not by coincidence, but because of Entity #002.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Two days ago, I received an urgent call from Dr. Emmanuel Sies, a psychological consultant who occasionally assisted ASID with analyzing unusual effects of cosmic radiation that might correlate with our cosmic disparity detection array. I&#39;d first met Emmanuel after my expedition to Deception Island in Antarctica, where he conducted the first tests on me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">His voice on the phone was strained, unlike the Dr Sies I knew.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&quot;Jaxton, something&#39;s wrong with my watch,&quot; he said with a worried voice. I could hear him trembling ever so slightly. &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s connected to what you found on Deception Island.&quot;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Emmanuel met me at his apartment after I rescheduled my other case, looking tired and sleep-deprived. On his coffee table lay a Rolex Submariner&mdash;an elegant timepiece I&#39;d seen him wear during our previous consultations&mdash;now glowing in a bright mint colour. Even he could not understand it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Before we knew it, we were pulled into a different dimension, but perhaps it was the most realistic dimension we had ever come across. We weren&#39;t travelling through time, though we were transported to Lower Manhattan. A strange, uneasy sensation crept down both our spines. At the time, we didn&#39;t know whether we had just skipped a portion of time due to the watch holding special properties or that this view we had was a different dimension. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">As we strolled the midtown streets, the day went on as normal. That was until we heard planes overhead. They crashed into the World Trade Center, destroying them and leaving a path of chaos. Hundreds died. Sies and I could only watch in horror. At the time, we didn&#39;t know if it was real, and if it wasn&#39;t was this really going to happen?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I wished I trusted my instincts though because what happened next was horrifying. Instead of the day continuing, we were pulled onto the plane, back in time. We were headed straight for the towers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Like birds in a storm, there was panic and chaos. There was no control. The terrorists looked everyone dead in their eyes, guns held high with an indomitable strength that would break anyone if they got close. But they didn&#39;t see me and Dr Sies. We managed to slip past the terrorists, into the cabin. There we saw the twin towers. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then the pilot looked at us, as if we stood there. He looked confident, remaining calm. &ldquo;Your country should&#39;ve done more for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Then, the mirage concluded, returning us back to Dr Sies&#39;s apartment. His watch stopped glowing. He then explained to me another incident that happened a day ago. He explained that last night, he was transported to another dimension. He entered a world where the 911 attacks never happened, a dimension where Middle-Eastern Countries thrived in abundance of technology.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Was this a warning? Well, we thought of it as just a dumb joke the supernatural decided to play on us. We didn&#39;t believe something as absurd as terrorists crashing into a plane would be viable for a day into the future back then. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">But that all changed on September 11th. Fate had come. The planes crashed. Thousands died. Entity 002 changed me and Dr Sies&#39;s perspectives, forcing us to either delve deeper into these cases or to close them. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This morning as of writing this report, I was notified about another possible Entity 004 that is linked to the Mona Lisa. I am closing this case as of now. Maybe I&#39;ll just get an intern to help me out on this one. </span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.ng7vb0c51qsa"><span class="c6">#6</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Topic: Aliens</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Case ID: 0002</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Check No. 1</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reporter: Prof. Alex Hoster</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Vardzia, Georgia</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 12 May, 2003</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My last case covered cosmic disparities, and maybe this new case may be linked. There&#39;s a new city in town, where we must question the reality we live in. Do aliens really exist? Is there life out there that is influencing humanity? Just a few questions the ASID must solve. It&#39;s no easy task.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It all started that one late afternoon, when I was reading the newspaper. The headline was bizarre to say the least. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Miracle City in Georgia&rdquo; it was titled, with pictures of people crowding the futuristic advanced city. Tourism was off the charts, but the publisher was the thing that caught me. It was Professor Alexander Hoster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Professor Alexander Hoster is a renowned archaeologist, recently completing an expedition to Vardzia, Georgia. After his last case in 1979, he discovered an extremely futuristic city now in place of the valleys. The article explained his research, unable to piece together how the city formed. He couldn&#39;t find any leads. That&#39;s when I took the initiative to call him, and little did I know, I would be dragging myself down into the largest rabbit holes I&#39;ve ever been in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Vardzia was a small city to say the least, but it thrived. Or should I call it Ajespa, that&#39;s what the locals said. Ajespa was more than a city when I arrived, the crystalline buildings with the perfect geometric linings. It felt like the Atlantis case all over again, it was too perfect to be true. But the problem was, it was true, perfect and flawless. There was no evil, tyrannical ruler, instead it was a council of the people. A democracy, perhaps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I scavenged the streets for clues, alleyways for hints. It was also excruciatingly clean, not much to work off. All that I saw seemed off of the city was the large amounts of cargo stockpiled all around, all with the same logo imprinted on it. I tried to execute an image search, but the logos didn&#39;t match anything with the registered international businesses. Perhaps it was off the grid? I&#39;d be so wrong.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The internet didn&#39;t help either, each search leading me to a dead end. Nothing and nothing. Professor Hoster finally suggested me to meet him in Hong Kong, where he would surprise me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A few days later, I landed in Chinese soil. The last time I was in this nation was about a decade or so, stationed also in Hong Kong. Professor Hoster&#39;s surprise was pleasant, he introduced me to Dr. Lok Chuy, who had a PhD in urbanisation. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Dr. Chuy suggested that supernatural forces may have aided the construction, stating that it was impossible for humankind to build such an advanced and large scale city in just a mere 19 years. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">You may wonder how we deduced that Ajespa began construction in 1981 and finished in 2000, but thanks to relations with people from NASA, I was able to get satellite imagery and deduce it from there. Nonetheless, we still didn&#39;t know what was happening. We were all still confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">But we didn&#39;t give up. Tens, then hundreds of photos of the mystical city enchanted our vision, blurring our thoughts. We tried to piece together the puzzle, but we were always just short. But then, something changed the following day. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After one of the best food spot discoveries, Professor Chuy and I stumbled upon an alleyway that led to a small warehouse. There, we saw the same logo from before. It was the same, geometric maroon logo I saw back in Vardzia. But this time, there was text.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;ANATEROS&rdquo; was etched into a plank of wood, immediately telling me the name of the organisation that might be behind the construction. We quickly filed back to the small apartment of Professor Chuy&#39;s, starting to look into Anateros.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Firstly, the main findings of the organisation are:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_87qmd7ff8rnd-0 start"><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">The name is derived from Greek, presumably the word &lsquo;Superior&rsquo;</span></li><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">It is a private organisation</span></li><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Their leader goes under the codename &lsquo;Lance&rsquo;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The Ajespa case is no short of something enormous. Whatever may lie behind the city, will give us more information on Anateros. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Check No. 2</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reporter: Mr Neuman Borne</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Gunkanjima, Japan</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 8th October, 2003</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Nothing is new. Just another possibility of extraterrestrial life. And we have evidence now. Our operations are in full swing, and the ASID is securing and tightening up. Mr. Neuman Borne, one of the newer recruits was tasked to investigate further into Anateros&#39;s plans, with some of our IT guys tracing network signals to a remote island in Japan. We sent Borne out 2 weeks ago to Gunkanjima and last week, we got good news.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I followed up and caught a plane there, needing to confirm what he had found. It truly shocked the entire organisation and it changed our perspectives on Anateros drastically. Let me tell you, this entire Ajespa case has been quite crazy. I will be calling the Ajespa City investigations off for now and redirecting it to investigate further on Anateros.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Perhaps until more reports on Ajespa and the goods Anateros supplies, we will open the case back up. And next time, I need to put my best man on the case. The problem? We don&#39;t have anyone of that caliber just yet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The larger image, the mystery of Ajespa is still yet unknown, too great for any of us to look into. What type of government is present there? Again, from our research, Professor Hoster claims that in ancient Georgia, monarchies ruled. Is there a king? Or perhaps a queen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My arrival to Gunkanjima Island was with haste, locating the small outpost Anateros had claimed. It was a small metal bunker that appeared innocent outside, but gazing into the small window the reinforced door had, there was a stairwell leading down. Borne and I laid low and scavenged the area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We found temporary work stations that seemed to once be there, but now moved underground. Their operation must have begun. They left behind a few pages of a notebook, most importantly, gave us vital information. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo; Borne hesitated. His voice still rang in my mind. His line was chilling, but there was no way what we read was a code. It was deciphered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">There were sketches of a human body with words labelled alien and Jespa. Is this a sign of extraterrestrial life? Either way, our organisation is here to end this. We will make things right. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Check No 3.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reported by Civilians</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Sacramento, California</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 1st January, 2004</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m working on New Year&#39;s day. But something horrific happened last night. Starstruck is the word I would use. I hope to never experience anything like this as I feel bad for the kid. Yesterday, after a day with some of our new interns in Sacramento, we gave lectures on the case of Ajespa, hoping to inspire any future detectives. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">One of our most eager listeners was a young, 27-year-old Stella Chi from Taiwan, wandering into the hall when we began. But the most suspicious thing happened after my speech. She personally asked me some questions, her voice was strangely unreal. She had no accent, though she was on a work visa here. It felt like I was interacting with an alien. Though, when she left, a black Honda picked her up, with a young boy sitting in the back. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be mesmerised by his void-like eyes, pure darkness. It felt like he gazed into my soul, cracking my identity to its core.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The car drove on. Then we noticed it. There was no licence plate. I didn&#39;t have a camera, so I couldn&#39;t capture it. It sped fast, fast enough that it crashed into the building next door. There was panic, chaos and fire. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It was 01:00 when the fire was finally put out, the car wrecked at the foundation of the 11 storey apartment. The woman and driver? Not dead. Not alive either. They were gone. No blood, no traces, no nothing. But the boy? Untouched. Unfazed, Fast asleep. I followed the doctors that hastily carried the boy to the hospital for checkups, knowing that this might give me a lead on the aliens. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I waited patiently. The beeps still beep in my mind. I almost fell asleep but at 02:45, the reports came in. 100% human. I was baffled. How could a boy be ungrazed by such a mighty flame? Intervention? No, it couldn&#39;t be. There had to be some supernatural causes. But still, no lead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The boy didn&#39;t look a year older than 4. Such a miracle to survive. Was that woman and driver his parents? To just disappear, just like that, abandoning their child? I ran checks with our international workers for the child&#39;s identity, but nothing came up. No matches. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Just another boy, left behind. I decided that once he grows old enough, he should learn about humanity. Our lives and how they are shaped by external forces. So I gave him up to a couple willing to adopt him the next morning. Still sound asleep. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Their voices were calm and sweet, they whispered his name. &ldquo;Elias,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&lt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nah, that&#39;s enough for the night,&rdquo; Elias said frustrated. &ldquo;Go to bed, Rae.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">He closed his laptop and pulled the USB out, handing it back to Rae.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo; Rae asked, her expression suddenly becoming worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Nothing. It&#39;s getting late. It&#39;s almost 1AM,&rdquo; Elias replied. &ldquo;Goodnight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Love you!&rdquo; Rae giggled, closing the door behind her. She trudged to her room, plugging the USB into her phone. She wanted to keep reading. Why did Elias just turn off his laptop? Why did he sound so angry? And most importantly, was that him? </span></p><h4 class="c11" id="h.g9yku4qxk3a1"><span class="c6">#7</span></h4><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&gt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Topic: Ancient Robots</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Case ID: 003</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Reported by: Prof. Alex Hoster</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Location: Vardzia, Georgia</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Date: 21st February, 2007</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Big news. We proved the historians wrong. At least that&#39;s what I believe. A few months ago, Professor Hoster found entrances in Vardzia, Georgia into ancient catacombs of some sorts. A group of archaeologists and scientists joined his small expedition, finding ancient robots. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">These ancient robots weren&#39;t new, historians had found them long ago. Probably a decade or so before. Though previous attempts to further analyse them proved difficult, they had believed the ancient Georgians were extremely smart until they were wiped out somehow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">What Hoster found was a true feat, something that transcended our beliefs of the Georgians. Their small team conducted the research in the catacombs, producing vital information. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I arrived back to Georgia last week, Hoster explained to me in great detail his findings, with the most notable being no trails of any kind. One may assume that when constructing these robots required manual labor, leaving behind footprints and fingerprints, but Hoster had conducted thorough investigation, exposing there to be none. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This grew my very suspicion of extraterrestrial life. With our encounters within the last few years, I was ready to make the hypothesis that there are indeed aliens. But I still didn&#39;t have enough evidence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">When I returned back to Indianapolis yesterday, I had a thought on how we could gather evidence. Our detectives have been working hard on cases, travelling internationally and conducting investigations. Who knows if Anateros is controlling this scheme? Are they trying to lie to us?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Are they trying to fool all of us, making our organisation think there&rsquo; aliens? Perhaps to waste millions of dollars funded into these operations?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Having now over 5 stations worldwide, I&#39;m working on a rebrand for the company. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Our latest knowledge points leads us to believe that:</span></p><ul class="c5 lst-kix_cyaqu1cfttr7-0 start"><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">There is a high chance of extraterrestrial life</span></li><li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">&lsquo;Lance&rsquo;, the leader of Anateros may be on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list.

I was about 20 km northwest of Alice Springs, where in a dry valley, a scattered patch of swamp green roots were sprouting ever so slightly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">As I neared the vegetation, I began to experience neurological responses marked by dizziness, spatial disorientation, and a dreamlike state of consciousness. Within moments, my vision blurred, and a sensation of sinking overcame me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The vision I gained was nothing short, I was transported somewhere. Although the location was the same, it didn&#39;t feel like I was on Earth, rather just a figment of my imagination or a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My instincts told me this was another cosmic disparity. I was about to lose my mind. It felt like an eternity, having to survive a good couple of days in my fantasy. I could see my surroundings as they were, yet I was trapped within a repetitive mental illusion that made me question whether time itself had stalled or was in a cyclic motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">My escape was purely circumstantial. A sudden and powerful gust of wind passed through the area, bringing a wave of fresh air. As the air cleared and diffused the sedative gas, the effect lifted slowly, and I regained partial motor control and awareness, enough to extract myself from the immediate vicinity. The symptoms subsided within seconds of exposure ceasing, though residual dizziness and psychological disorientation lingered for several hours afterward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">I then looked at the sky. I was glad that time in the real world didn&#39;t pass extremely long, it looked like it had passed about 8 hours. During my time being sedated, I can roughly recall I was in the illusion for about 8 days, suggesting that the drug time dilation is exactly 1 day to 1 hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">After transporting myself to Darwin where I went for a checkup on any side-effects the drug gave me, I rang up a scientist I knew well, Dr. Harold Flemmings. I told him about the drug, his voice sounded worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This case is too dangerous for anyone to analyse further at this point in time. I&#39;m scared of going back, even for the smallest sample. Maybe once Project XXVII is complete, we may grab a sample. I&#39;m closing this case as of right now.</span></p></body></html>
