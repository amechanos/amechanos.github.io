It was extremely hot, and Ashley did not enjoy it at all. Living in Australia was hard enough, but traveling to such an isolated place in such hot conditions was killing her, physically and mentally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Though she was at a young age of 16, she hated school and disliked what she had to go through. The education system was extremely poorly designed, consisting of content that one didn&rsquo;t need at all in the future. As the minibus pulled up on the side of the road next to the humongous rock, the students of Valley High School flocked out from the bus one by one. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ashley Thyst!&quot; the teacher called out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Here&hellip;&rdquo; Ash mumbled, tying up her scarf to protect her from the sun. As she stepped out of the old minibus, the sun blinded her, the beams shining directly into her blue eyes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;How do you even manage to wear that scarf of yours, Thyst?&quot; the teacher asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I hate the sun&hellip;It&rsquo;s also my dad&rsquo;s.&quot; Ash replied stubbornly, walking towards the rock at her own accord. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash wandered around the base of the massive sandstone monolith, her fingers trailing lightly over the ancient carvings etched into its weathered surface. The grooves and patterns felt alive beneath her touch, as if whimsical stories were etched into the rock itself. It was clear this landmark was a sacred piece of Aboriginal history, preserved and protected for generations. But Ash had never been one to follow the rules. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She was a rebel, through and through. Rules were more like suggestions to her, and the constant drone of her teacher&rsquo;s voice about the geological wonders of Ayers Rock only fueled her desire to break free. While the group stood clustered together, listening intently, Ash was on the other side of the rock. Her eyes scanned the rock face for a way up and with a mischievous grin, she found her footholds and began to climb, her movements quick and deliberate. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The top of the monolith was unlike anything she&rsquo;d expected. The surface was uneven, scattered with rocks that seemed deliberately placed. Ash crouched down, her curiosity piqued. She pressed her hand against one of the rocks, and to her surprise, it shifted. With a soft grinding sound, a small opening appeared in the rock. Her heart raced as she glanced over her shoulder to make sure no one had noticed. The coast was clear. Without a second thought, she slid through the narrow gap and into the cool, dark embrace of the monolith.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Inside, the air was still and cool, carrying the faint scent of earth and time. The darkness was absolute, but Ash wasn&rsquo;t afraid. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her trusty flashlight, flicking it on. The beam of light cut through the blackness, illuminating the walls of the cave. Her breath caught in her throat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whoa&hellip;&rdquo; she whispered, her voice barely audible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The walls were covered in intricate carvings&mdash;ancient markings that told stories she couldn&rsquo;t yet understand. Strange drawings of people with slingshots and other tools seemed to dance in the flickering light. But what really caught her eye was an icon on the far left side of the cave. It depicted five creatures, one at the center surrounded by four others, each with distinct markings and styles. They seemed almost&hellip; alive, as if they were watching her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash leaned closer, her flashlight trembling slightly in her hand. The carvings were mesmerizing, pulling her into their mystery. But just as she reached out to touch the central figure, a faint sound broke the silence. It was soft, almost melodic, like the chirp of a small bird. She froze, her pulse quickening. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the shadows, something moved. Ash jerked back, her flashlight beam darting toward the source. There, emerging from the darkness, was a small, glowing creature. It was unlike anything she&rsquo;d ever seen&mdash;a slug, but not quite. Its body shimmered with an otherworldly light, casting faint patterns on the cave walls as it inched closer. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&rsquo;s breath hitched. She didn&rsquo;t know whether to run or stay, but one thing was certain: she had stumbled into something far bigger than she could have imagined. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What are you?&quot; Ash asked, her voice filled with awe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The slug seemed excited, signaling for Ash to follow. Intrigued, she did. The walls were murky, overgrown with moss that seeped into the cracks. A faint dripping sound echoed throughout the dense tunnel, spooking Ash out even more. The deeper into the tunnel they went, it felt more claustrophobic until they reached a small opening, with a slate standing in solitude with mysterious writing engraved in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Protected by the Thyst Family&quot; Ash read aloud, her eyes widening. &quot;Is this fate?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The slug hopped onto the slate, pointing to a set of symbols: Chaos, Time, Space, and Persistence. It then jumped under the Time symbol, revealing its name&mdash;Tempora.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Tempora?&quot; Ash mused. &quot;What is this place? Is it this Slugterra place dad always mentioned?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The slug nodded. Ash rolled her eyes, but she knew it was better than going back. She chuckled, assuming that she was to carry on some legacy of some sort. &ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll name you Vinnie for short, I really don&rsquo;t like the name Tempora&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The slug jumped up happily. Ash picked it up, giggling. &quot;Aren&#39;t you a cute one?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The slug motioned Ash to follow and Ash followed eagerly, navigating the dark tunnels. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the slug&rsquo;s faint glow, she could never see in these tunnels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie soon led Ash to a seat of some kind that was hidden behind a pile of rubble, practically invisible to a human.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;So this is the drop my dad told me about... A way to Slugterra!&quot; Ash exclaimed, sitting down. Vinnie nodded. &quot;Does this thing still work?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She pushed the button beside the seat and nothing happened. The ground opened up beneath her, and she fell.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s scream echoed as she plummeted, but her fall slowed dramatically. Vinnie had reached velocimorph form, activating its time-slowing ability.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Huh? What&#39;s happening?&quot; Ash exclaimed, her panic turning to confusion as she floated gently down. Ash forcefully pushed the restraints back, and carefully stood up. As they neared the ground, Ash jumped out of the seat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She landed safely on the ground, the surreal landscape of Slugterra stretching out before her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Vinnie, so this is Slugterra?&quot; she asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie nodded, hopping onto her shoulder. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&quot;So where are we off to?&quot; Ash was indeed puzzled by the labyrinth of caverns Slugterra had to offer as she had no idea where to start. Heck, she didn&#39;t even know which direction to start exploring in.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.e0hgmac788q"><span class="c3">Chapter 2</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The fantastical landscape was so surreal that Ash couldn&rsquo;t piece together her thoughts. She imagined Slugterra would mirror the land above, all sand and desert, with extremely humid and hot weather conditions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It wasn&rsquo;t long for her to realise that the spot she had landed was actually a small oasis surrounded by a barren scrapland full of sand and strong winds. Metallic scraps dug into the sand and rocks pierced the earth, creating an unsettling tone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; Ash asked Vinnie, who hopped on ahead. Vinnie directed Ash through the desert and soon found a small gravel path that seemed to lead somewhere. And it did lead to a place, a city to be specific. It was Steamvale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bustling town of Steamvale welcomed Ash with its steampunk charm. As she wandered through the streets, Ash marvelled at the intricate machinery and the mechanical marvels that adorned the town. The sign reading &quot;Welcome to Steamvale&quot; greeted her, giving her a sense of both excitement and trepidation. Vinnie, her newly named Tempora slug, perched on her shoulder, eyeing the surroundings with equal curiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s thirst led her to the Blackboar Tavern, a place that seemed lively despite the early hour. As she entered, the smoky aroma of grilled food filled the air. The bar was crowded with patrons, their eyes following her every move. Ash tried to ignore the stares and approached the counter. A large, burly man with a gruff demeanor stepped forward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Can I get a drink?&quot; Ash asked politely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bartender laughed, his voice booming. &quot;A drink? You got an ID?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Uhm&hellip;No?&quot; she replied, feeling slightly uneasy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bartender&#39;s expression changed from amusement to disdain. &quot;Well, get outta here! We don&rsquo;t serve minors!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Laughter erupted from the patrons, and Ash&#39;s face burned with humiliation. &quot;Not even water?&quot; she demanded, her voice shaking with anger. The patrons laughed even harder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;No water! You wanna fight for some?&quot; the bartender challenged, pointing a blaster loaded with a Ramstone slug at her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash backed away, hands raised. &quot;Okay, sorry! I&#39;ll leave!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">She stormed out of the tavern, her cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and fury. &quot;What&rsquo;s up with them?&quot; she muttered to Vinnie. &quot;Are all these people like this??&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie shrugged, not having an answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Determined to find some respite, Ash entered the Cloudwork Tavern that stood in the corner of the town. The bells jingled as she stepped inside, the place smaller and more rugged than the previous one. Cobwebs adorned the corners, and a slug dashed out the door as she entered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;New customer?&quot; the bartender said, looking up from his work.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Not popular like the others?&quot; Ash asked, sceptical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What do you think? You got eyes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You want a drink? You seem dehydrated,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yes please,&quot; Ash sighed, sweat dripping from her forehead. She slicked back her messy sienna hair, getting a better view of the tavern&rsquo;s interior.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The bartender poured her a glass of water, and Ash drank it down gratefully. &quot;You&#39;re Leon Thyst&rsquo;s daughter, aren&rsquo;t you?&quot; he asked, observing her closely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;How&#39;d you know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, the scarf, isn&rsquo;t it obvious? And your slug,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s eyes widened in surprise, flustered. Her cheeks blushed cherry red. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Leon Thyst, your father, was a frequent customer here. Anyone would recognize that Tempora slug. It&#39;s his signature slug.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s heart skipped a beat. &quot;How do you know my father? Why did he come here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;The name&#39;s Lance,&quot; the bartender introduced himself. He flicked back his silky golden hair and continued, &quot;My father was a sniper back in his day, but when he hurt his back, he retired. He was your father&#39;s best friend, so he got me to help him when he retired. I&#39;ve since mastered the sniper.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;So, how old are you now?&quot; Ash inquired, intrigued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Sixteen. A master of the sniper. My father&#39;s sniper genes allowed me to master this stuff in just three years... and I&#39;ve helped your father once before he disappeared.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s eyes sparkled with hope. &quot;Oh... Say, do you wanna join me and find out where my father went?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ummm&hellip;sure?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;By the way, do you at least have a blaster?&quot; Lance asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash shook her head. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t have any...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance sighed and stood up. &quot;Alright, follow me. I wanna show you something...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance led Ash out the back door of the Cloudwork Tavern. The light of the crystals overhead reflected off the metallic surfaces of the steampunk town, casting a bright glare. Lance stopped beside a sleek, gleaming mech. Customised with a dingo shaped head, the mech looked modern and sleek.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;This is my ride,&quot; Lance said proudly, patting the dingo&#39;s head. &quot;A Voltswagon GTI, the latest model around. Your father left his mech too. It&#39;s old but super customised. The engineer behind it was none other than the great Maven.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&#39;s eyes widened as she walked over and took the ragged sheets off the mech. Her eyes widened at the sight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Wow! It looks so cool! And it&#39;s super clean!&quot; Ash exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance nodded, a grin spreading across his face. &quot;Your dad did have some style!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash got on, turned the engine on and the mech roared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, we&#39;re getting you a blaster first so follow me. Driving these mechs is easy, c&#39;mon!&quot; Lance smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash pulled the gear down and the beast accelerated, speeding off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Ash exclaimed, trying to maintain her balance. Lance laughed and rode parallel to Ash, helping her get a grip on her mecha beast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The journey through the desert was challenging, at least for Ash. It was her first time driving, let alone driving a four-legged beast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The desert stretched endlessly under the blazing sun, its dunes shimmering like molten gold. The air rippled with heat, distorting the horizon into a mirage of liquid light. The rhythmic thud of mechanical legs echoed across the barren expanse as their mechs marched forward, their massive frames kicking up clouds of fine sand that hung in the air like glittering dust. Each step sent a cascade of golden particles swirling around them, diffusing the Solaryte light into a hazy glow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Why is it so hot anyway?&quot; Ash asked, wiping sweat from her brow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t know much. Just a bunch of myths that date back hundreds of years. And the water? The Kinderling dried it up. It&#39;s capable of evaporating liquids very quickly. Quite deadly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He brought the mech to a halt and gestured toward a large, industrial-looking door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; Lance grumbled. The exterior of the forge was more torn down the last time he had come. Scraps at the door and more dents in the door. The rusted walls stood high and Lance approached it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance knocked on the door. &quot;Hey pops! New girl wants her first blaster. Can you do something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The door creaked open, and a figure approached them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Who&#39;s this?&quot; The man growled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Grayroad, this is Ashley, she&#39;s new around here so I&#39;d thought we&#39;d be able to pop in...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grayroads&#39;s thin physique along with his grey lightning bolt-shaped moustache stood out to Ash whose eyes lit up. He walked with a noticeable limp, his prosthetic leg clunking against the floor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grayroad sighed and sat down in a chair, taking a sip of his coffee. &quot;Lance, you know it&#39;s been tough lately. The Emperor and his War Boys have been raiding my supplies. I don&#39;t know if I can make a blaster for her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance&#39;s expression hardened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Grayroad, you have to! She&#39;s a close friend of Maven...&quot; Lance lied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grayroad&#39;s eyes widened in recognition. &quot;Maven? Say no more. However, I still need materials. A Nimbus accelerator, a solaryte fragment, and a cryosphere magnet. I have the perfect blaster in mind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance nodded. &quot;Alright then. But she&#39;s unarmed for now. Do you have anything she can use while we hunt?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grayroad stood up and rummaged through a chest, pulling out an old, yet well-maintained blaster. &quot;Take this... your father&#39;s old blaster. It&#39;ll keep up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash accepted the blaster with a mix of gratitude and reverence. &quot;Thanks.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, the door was kicked open. A large figure stormed in, dual blasters drawn and ready to fire. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You&#39;ve got some nerve still coming to this old geezer&#39;s place! Give me all your slugs! And where&#39;s the Solaryte Battery we asked for?&quot; the intruder demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s almost done!&quot; Grayroad&#39;s hands trembled slightly as he scrambled through his drawers looking for the blueprint.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Hey... you&#39;re messing with the wrong people!&quot; Lance stepped forward, his eyes narrowing. Reaching for his blaster, his speedstinger slug jumped in ready for action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash, her heart pounding, backed him up. &quot;Yeah! What he said!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;And what?&quot; the intruder yelled as he hauled two Tempestos at Lance and Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a swift motion, Ash pulled out her blaster and fired her Tempora slug. Vinnie&#39;s time-slowing ability activated, giving Lance the chance to fire his Speedstinger slug. The brute was hit directly in the face, falling to the ground with a heavy thud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Impressive, but Tempora ain&#39;t gonna be useful in all situations.&quot; Lance nodded. &quot;I could&#39;ve taken him out without the use of your slug.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Her name is Vinnie!&quot; Ash scoffed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh, naming slugs, are we? Meet Bingo.&quot; Lance smiled, introducing his own slug, a Speedstinger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Grayroad approached, his expression serious. &quot;Kid, Lance is right. That one Tempora slug ain&#39;t enough. Being a Thyst means you fight, fight the emperor and stop the mess. This place is already a wasteland. Take my Forgesmelter. It&#39;s rare and packs a big punch.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Thank you.&quot; Ash said happily, accepting the slug in her palms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance guided Ash back to their mechs. &quot;Follow me. We need to gather those parts.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">As they sped off toward Vein Rocks, Ash felt a mix of fear and excitement. She was on the path her father once walked, ready to uncover the secrets of his past and forge her own destiny in Slugterra.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.f522mwt69il0"><span class="c3">Chapter 3</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Solaryte crystals radiated an intense heat, beaming upon the duo. Their journey was arduous enough, and for them to be now travelling through the Vein Rocks was no easy challenge. Towering, needle-like rock formations twisted and warped in every direction, creating a claustrophobic atmosphere with only slim gaps between them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ramstone slugs called these rocks home, perched atop these jagged formations. One peeked out from a small cave, observing Ash and Lance speeding through the vein rocks. Nothing but galloping of the mech&#39;s legs was heard in the distant regions of the outback. The Vein Rocks was already considered a barren and isolated place among the other caverns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a small clearing within the Vein Rocks, a fire burned beside a solitary figure. The man, rugged and weathered, sat in the sweltering heat, his blaster lying at his side. A Grimstone slug loaded in the weapon snarled quietly, ready for action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Ash and Lance continued their journey, Ash began to wonder how on earth these rocks came to existence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;So what are we getting from this place? It&#39;s a mad labyrinth!&quot; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;There&#39;s a rumour about a hermit named Elias. His blaster is special; it can fire Maximorph slugs at 350 kilometres an hour. Normally, only sniper rifles can achieve that speed, but the Nimbus accelerator in his blaster makes it possible.&quot; Lance replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What happens to the slugs if they go that fast?&quot; Ash questioned. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Slugs gain an extra ability in Maximorph form,&quot; Lance explained. &quot;For instance, Bingo here can home in on a target. I don&#39;t even need to aim and it&#39;ll hit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance suddenly slowed down and his eyes fixed upward. &quot;There&rsquo;s a Ramstone up there, look, Ash!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash slowed down as well and glanced up just in time to see the Ramstone slug retreat into its hole. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Why&rsquo;d it run away?&quot; Ash asked in a worried voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It&rsquo;s not you. Look behind you&hellip;&quot; Lance&#39;s voice trailed off as he noticed a figure sitting on a rock towering above them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What are you doing here, mates? This is my territory!&quot; Elias called out, his voice a low growl. Elias was the desert hermit. His deeply tanned skin and sun-bleached beard gave him a wild, untamed appearance. His piercing green eyes, sharp and alert, contrasted with his simple, tattered robes and the assortment of crude tools and charms hanging around his neck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash and Lance froze. Elias pulled out his blaster with the Grimstone slug within snarling, eager to be fired. Lance carefully inspected the blaster then noticed something strange. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Where did you get that ghoul from?&quot; Lance asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias chuckled evilly. &quot;Oh, Lance&hellip; Working for the emperor has its benefits!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash turned to Lance, puzzled. &quot;Just how well known are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, I was the talk of the town after your father disappeared&hellip;&quot; Lance replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias&#39;s eyes gleamed with interest. &quot;So, who&rsquo;s this new girl? Looks like someone who&rsquo;d sell well on the market!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias didn&#39;t hesitate to fire the Maximorphed Grimstone. The relentless ghoul hit the ground, and pillars of rock erupted, shattering the earth floor. Ash and Lance barely had time to react as they sped off on their mechs, trying to avoid the velocimorphed slug. The Grimstone, determined, ricocheted off the ground and aimed for Ash, knocking her off her mech and sending her blaster flying in the opposite direction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ahh!&quot; Ash cried out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;This stupid accelerator! Why does it take so long to charge back up? Oh well, I don&rsquo;t need another shot that strong to finish you off&hellip;&quot; Elias grumbled in frustration. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance, seeing an opportunity, turned and charged at Elias. His beast scaled the rocks and pounced on Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; He yelled. Lance jumped off his mech and tackled Elias, pushing him into the rocky ground, causing his blaster to fall next to Ash. Vinnie leapt into action, jumping into the empty capsule in the blaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias struggled against Lance. &quot;Get your dirty hands off me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a surge of strength, Elias pushed Lance away and lunged at Ash. Desperate, Ash grabbed Elias&#39;s blaster and fired it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ash no! Vinnie might not be able to Maximorph yet!&quot; Lance exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was too late. As Elias descended with rage filled in his arms that radiated a menacing aura, Ash pulled the trigger. Vinnie flew out, exploded with a million lights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie swooped down low and tapped Elias gently, freezing him in motion. Elias growled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is this sorcery?&rdquo; he scowled, almost being able to reach Ash. He effortlessly flailed his arms around trying to hit Ash, but his arms felt like they were frozen in time of some sort. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Vinnie, what is this?&rdquo; Ash remarked as she slid away from Elias. &ldquo;Vinnie?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie had flown much higher, up to the top of a vein rock. Vinnie had a different idea and was communicating with a Ramstone that was living in the small hole. As Vinnie descended the vein rock and came back around, it tapped Elias once again, resuming his path in time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He crashed into the ground with a loud thud, then a red trail soared down from the sky. The Ramstone slug had reached velocimorph as well, now plummeting down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias was bewildered by this sight and wasn&rsquo;t able to react to the speeding red and blue slug as it crashed into his body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aargh!&rdquo; Elias yelled, squealing in pain. Vinnie and the Ramstone landed gently on his body, both laughing and pointing at him. Ash giggled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash knelt down, extending a hand and smiled at the Ramstone. &quot;Hey there, buddy&hellip; Do you wanna join my team?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie nodded at the Ramstone and the Ramstone happily jumped into Ash&#39;s hand. &ldquo;How&#39;s the name Rocky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Hey, we gotta get the part we need. Think that forgesmelter would be really handy in disassembling this blaster&hellip;&quot; Lance interrupted. He glanced at Elias, ensuring he was unconscious, then helped Ash to her feet. &quot;Caster, you up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Caster nodded. Ash fired Caster at Elias&#39;s blaster, successfully splitting the Nimbus accelerator from the main weapon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance sighed. &quot;Blaster&rsquo;s totaled. This guy will be out of commission for a while&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, Elias crawled up, barely able to stand. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It isn&#39;t over! I&#39;ve saved the best for last!&rdquo; Elias shouted as he weakly inserted a Solaryte Crystal into a thin tube, throwing it at Ash and Lance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash reacted quickly, firing Rocky. It shattered the crystal and the tube instantly, creating a dazzling formation of tiny golden shards that flew down like needles of rain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Ash cheered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ash, you&#39;re so dumb! Run!&rdquo; Lance shouted as he pulled on Ash&#39;s arm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What about Rocky?&quot; Ash protested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;He&#39;ll be fine! Come on!&quot; Lance urged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Solaryte crystal shards hit the ground, causing rock pillars to shoot up. Ash and Lance made a break for it, traversing the pillars and escaping the Vein Rocks with the Nimbus Accelerator in hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rocky, caught in the chaos swiftly used the high velocity rock pillars that shot out as a method to velocimorph itself. Rocky elegantly caught up to Ash, landing on her shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We did it, guys!&quot; Ash exclaimed. Lance drifted his mech along the sandy ground, coming to a stop. Ash followed, stopping beside Lance and looked back at the Vein Rocks which had been littered with even more pillars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A loud growl rumbled from behind them with a menacing digging sound becoming clearer and clearer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What was that?&quot; Ash asked, fear creeping into her voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Trouble,&quot; Lance replied. &quot;Rockmites. We&#39;re gonna be their dinner unless we run&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash and Lance both turned back around and started their mechs and sped through the outback, galloping hastily on the rocky terrain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Rockmite chased them relentlessly. It growled, reverberating through the air, sounding like a wailing siren.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We can outrun it if we go to the Bomb Flats!&quot; Lance shouted over his shoulder, his voice filled with urgency.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Lead the way!&quot; Ash responded. She looked back and saw the massive stingers on the Rockmite. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They dashed towards the Bomb Flats, a desolate area known for its unique and dangerous rock formations. As they crossed into the Flats, the Rockmite abruptly stopped its pursuit and retreated. The Bomb Flats&#39; strange, archway-like rock formations along with the hundreds of Hoprocks and Grenukes provided a sanctuary from the creature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Why did it stop?&quot; Ash asked, glancing back at the retreating Rockmite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It&#39;s the Bomb Flats. The Rockmite won&#39;t follow us here,&quot; Lance explained, his breath heavy from the exertion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Grenukes, Hoprocks, and even sometimes Armashelts call this place home. The Rockmites are scared of explosions and hate the heat. That&rsquo;s why when the Solaryte shards hit the ground, it woke it up,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Oh&hellip;&quot; Ash replied as she gazed up. Ash looked around, her eyes widening at the sight of various slugs clinging to the rocky ceiling.&nbsp; She was immediately mesmerised by the sight above her. Suddenly, they were interrupted by voices echoing through the Flats.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;If you&#39;re here for trouble&hellip;&quot; a stern voice began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We won&#39;t hesitate to make you slug food!&quot; another voice chimed in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance&#39;s face lit up with recognition. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Clive! Clove! My friends!&quot; Lance exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two brothers Clive and Clove, although looking quite fat and innocent, were two beasts with the strength of a tiger. They slowly approached Ash and Lance on their emerald green mechs, and eyed Ash and Lance warily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We aren&#39;t your friends any more, loverboy,&quot; Clive spat, his tone filled with resentment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We work for the emperor now!&quot; Clove added, his eyes narrowing as she aimed a Doomspiker at Lance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Clive! Clove! What&#39;s going on?&quot; Lance asked, a mix of confusion and concern in his voice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;We&#39;re looking for the guy with the Cryosphere Magnet,&quot; Clive explained, his voice gruff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, it looks like we have a common goal,&quot; Lance said, trying to keep the peace. &quot;How about we team up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I dunno, Lance&hellip; should we?&rdquo; Clove mocked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Alright! Can you shut the hell up? Otherwise, I&#39;ll blast this Doomspiker in your face!&quot; barked Clive. His patience was wearing thin. The tension hung heavy in the air as they stood in the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright then, we&#39;ll be off. Let&#39;s go Lance.&rdquo; Ash signalled as she started moving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait what? Alrighty then,&rdquo; Lance replied, quickly catching up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So uh&hellip;are they supposed to leave or what?&rdquo; Clive asked, lowering his blaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I dunno Clive! You tell me! You&#39;re the one with the blaster!&rdquo; Clove shouted. He angrily got on his mech and kicked Clive&rsquo;s mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey what was that for?&rdquo; Clive asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;For being a dumbass,&rdquo; Clove replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Bomb Flats was indeed a beautiful place, but now Ash knew that it was also extremely dangerous. One wrong move and the Grenukes would fall from the rock formations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Ash and Lance ventured deeper into the flats, it felt like they were travelling in an endless plain of nothingness. There was nothing in sight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&#39;s the Cryosphere Magnet?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dunno&hellip;&rdquo; Lance replied. Then, in the corner of his eye, Lance spotted smoke. &ldquo;Over there!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash and Lance slowly approached the small flicker of fire that was in the distance. For once, they saw huge cliffs that dangled over the Bomb Flats. The edges of the flats were finally visible and an artificial path was in sight that led to the exit of the treacherous plains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash, come on!&rdquo; Lance urged. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright!&rdquo; Ash exclaimed. They sped towards the small campsite. There, a molenoid was sound asleep. Laying beside the warm aura of the fire were remnants of food such as fruit cores and meat bones. &ldquo;What in the&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dig around and see if the Cryosphere magnet is here&hellip;&rdquo; Lance whispered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip;Let&#39;s just go&hellip;&rdquo; Ash whispered back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you two creeps still lurking around here?&rdquo; Clive echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We thought you left! Plus, that Cryosphere Magnet cannot function without one of these babies!&rdquo; Clove shouted, holding out a tube with a shiny solaryte fragment inside. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blast their mechs!&rdquo; Clive roared. Clive and Clove unloaded a barrage of Hoprocks at the camp, waking the sleeping molenoid up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Urgh, what fool decides to disrupt the peaceful slumber of the greatest molenoid ever lived?&rdquo; the molenoid groaned. Rubbing its eyes, the molenoid&#39;s eyes widened at the sight of Clive and Clove, enraged almost immediately. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Clive! Clove! You two troublemakers&hellip;&rdquo; the molenoid yelled. &ldquo;Why do you keep coming to my home? There&#39;s no trespassing around here!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since when did you own the Bomb Flats? Additionally there ain&#39;t no sign that states we are trespassing,&rdquo; barked Clive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, no, no. You are disrespecting Worlem the Conqueror!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed. Ash rolled her eyes and Lance couldn&#39;t help but facepalm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look to your left stupid mole!&rdquo; Clove added. Worlem&#39;s eyes darted and saw Ash and Lance beside him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;When did you two spawn in?&rdquo; Worlem asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Ash smiled, waving to Worlem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eek! A Thyst!&rdquo; Worlem shrieked. Ash was confused and jerked back, surprised by the fact a mole knew her name. Worlem scrambled to his blaster, revealing the cryosphere magnet. Loading a Glowbyss, Worlem quickly fired the slug and blinded everyone, sprinting away to his mech and rode as fast as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s the Cryosphere Magnet! Get him!&rdquo; Clive yelled. Clive and Clove followed closely, right on Worlem&#39;s trail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&#39;s no time to lose!&rdquo; Lance shouted. Ash and Lance got back on their mechs and followed the others. Worlem looked back, realising Clive and Clove were close behind him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was like a highway chase straight out of a movie as the three groups chased each other. Lance leant back and extended his blaster, turning it into an intimidating sniper rifle. &ldquo;Alright Bingo, let&#39;s throw these two off in just one hit&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance aimed carefully and shot Bingo, who entered Maximorph form. Bingo swiftly unscrewed the screws of the legs that attached to Clive and Clove&#39;s mechs, leaving them tumbling onto the ground. &ldquo;Yes, Bingo!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eek! The Thyst! She&#39;s still here!&rdquo; Worlem whimpered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem, wait! Let me explain!&rdquo; Lance yelled. Worlem hit the brakes and clumsily flew off his mech onto the ground. Ash giggled as she came to a stop with Lance stopping beside Worlem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We ain&#39;t done!&rdquo; Clive roared as he sprinted towards Ash. Clove, while running, shot a Hoprock at the ceiling with the idea of a sign of battle. Grenukes and Hoprocks began to rain down like droplets of rain, all velocimorphing and becoming dangerous threats. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Clove, what are you doing? Why did you shoot! We&#39;re all doomed now, thanks to you flopper-brain!&rdquo; Clive retreated, yanking Clove along with him. &ldquo;Let&#39;s go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The twins ran off, escaping the chaotic mess the velocimorphing slugs were about to create.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh floppers&hellip;&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed. Ash stepped back, tripping on a small rock. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Ash exclaimed as she fell on the ground. As Ash stood up, she spotted a small rock that covered a small burrow in the hard, stone ground. She quickly bent down and saw a Tormato slug in the small opening scared. &ldquo;It&#39;s alright&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Vinnie hopped down and invited the Tormato to join. Rocky also jumped down and signalled for the Tormato to come out. The two slugs panicked, motioning in terror to the Tormato for its help. The Tormato slug was traumatised with the voices that surrounded it, but it jumped out with confidence, knowing that this task was dependent on it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, show us what you can do!&rdquo; Ash exclaimed as she instantly loaded the new Tormato slug in her blaster. She shot the Tormarto up. The Tormato slug created a devastating tornado that pulled all the Grenukes and Hoprocks together and directed them at Clive and Clove.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Ash celebrated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Clive, we better run&hellip;faster!&rdquo; Clove exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Good one, Sherlock!&rdquo; Clive scoffed, jumping onto his mech. The barrage of slugs ultimately failed to reach them and the twins had barely escaped the Bomb Flats in one piece.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice one Ash,&rdquo; Lance commented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Ash replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Since when did the assassin himself befriend a Thyst?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That guy! Lance Freeman&hellip;The legendary sniper who assassinated Leon Thyst&hellip;&rdquo; Worlem whimpered, scared that Ash would blow his brains out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem&hellip;&rdquo; Lance mumbled under his teeth. Anger reached his mind as he became enraged. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lance&hellip;You&hellip;You killed my father?&rdquo; Ash gasped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash&hellip;Please calm down, I can explain&hellip;&rdquo; Lance stuttered, calming himself down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No you don&#39;t!&rdquo; Ash yelled. She aimed Rocky at Lance&rsquo;s face, but hesitated from pulling the trigger. &ldquo;Trying to lure me into a trap as well?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&#39;t understand!&rdquo; Lance shouted. Ash pulled the trigger, knocking Lance back onto the ground. Ash loaded Caster into her blaster and shot it at Worlem&#39;s blaster. The Cryosphere magnet slid apart from the blaster and Ash quickly snatched it away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! What are you doing?&rdquo; Worlem shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m done with you Lance. I can solve my own mysteries,&rdquo; Ash scoffed. Ash started the engine of her mech and sped off into the outback.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She isn&#39;t surviving it&hellip;&rdquo; Lance said as he weakly stood up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You got that right Lance&hellip;&rdquo; Worlem laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up midget!&rdquo; Lance yelled as he kicked a rock. &ldquo;You ruined it! The rebellion is never going to rise!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Terrible luck, I guess,&rdquo; Worlem sighed. He put a hand on Lance&#39;s shoulder. Lance couldn&#39;t help himself but cry quietly, all sad and miserable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You had to tell the truth to her!&rdquo; Lance wailed. &ldquo;It wouldn&#39;t hurt if we broke it later! She&#39;ll never trust me again&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry Lance. I truly am,&rdquo; Worlem sighed. Worlem realised that he was to blame. A Thyst that would agree to help the rebellion? That was the last thing Worlem had imagined. He couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine what it would be like. The empire was only getting stronger by the minute and hope was broken. Was getting Ash to join the rebellion actually a good idea? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">No one had ever thought about that possibility, but it seemed the most promising. Somehow, Lance knew that he was the one who had to convince Ash to join him again and to regain her trust.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.a32u39m58w6x"><span class="c3">Chapter 4</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash was left confused and shocked. For her only friend to be revealed as an assassin of her own father left Ash hopeless. She had trusted Lance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What a creep,&rdquo; Ash thought. She couldn&#39;t get her mind off why Lance would do such a thing. She held back her tears and kept riding on her mech. Soon, she arrived back at Grayroad&rsquo;s place. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You get the parts, eh?&rdquo; Grayroad mumbled as he opened the door for Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yep, I do,&rdquo; Ash replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&#39;d Lance run off to?&rdquo; Grayroad asked as he inspected the parts. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He said he needed to take care of some business and for me to come first,&rdquo; Ash lied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright. Do you mind if you run and get something for me?&rdquo; Grayroad requested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uhm, sure&hellip;&rdquo; Ash grinned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The ducts&hellip;Don&#39;t know if you know where it is but it&#39;s a bit south from here. It&#39;s an abandoned warehouse that has tunnels that lead to underground caverns. If you explore enough, you&#39;ll find a rogue there. Part of the rebellion&hellip;She&#39;s important to me. Bring her back here and you&#39;ll prove your worth&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s their name?&rdquo; Ash questioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Forgot. All I know is that she&#39;s the wiz that can finish your blaster. She&#39;s Maven&#39;s daughter and went into hiding after the empire took Maven away,&rdquo; Grayroad remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, then I&#39;ll be going. Thanks!&rdquo; Ash replied. She left the warehouse and sped towards the south. As Ash traversed the outback, she finally took some time to look around and truly appreciate the beauty of the outback. It was calm and peaceful, with occasional sandworms jumping out of the sand beside her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It wasn&#39;t long until Ash reached the Outpost. A small wasteland with scavengers that would look for different parts. As Ash slowly circled the area, a mech approached her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A Thyst, eh?&rdquo; a voice chirped, staring at the Tempora slug that perched on her shoulder. &ldquo;Not sure why a royal like you would be out here in such a low-class place&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you? How do you know me?&rdquo; Ash asked, reaching for her blaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s alright, no need to get fighty. My name&#39;s Leia Fernux.&rdquo; Leia smiled. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;re you headed?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The Ducts&hellip;Why?&rdquo; Ash asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with being a Thyst?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, nothing,&rdquo; Leia remarked. &ldquo;Just beware, it&#39;s worm territory ahead. Careful crossing!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; Ash scoffed. She trudged past the Outpost where eyes focused on her. She ignored the looks and carried on. Through the warm breeze, Ash entered the worm territory. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Loud, painful screams erupted from the ground and suddenly, a humongous Sand Leech leapt out of the sand. A Sand Angler and Tormato dangled on the huge fangs of the beast and the mouth of the Sand Leech widened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A loud, deafening whirring sound filled the air as the two slugs got sucked into the mouth. The Sand Leech&#39;s head tilted down, aimed at Ash, and spat out the two slugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Sand Angler and Tormato combined into a deadly fusion that sparked a devastating sandstorm immediately and Ash dashed out, barely dodging it. However, the sandstorm was still well alive and sand was chasing Ash down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the distance, a faint turquoise-blue colour zipped across, and the image of an Armashelt slug became clearer and clearer. Following closely behind, a Crystalyd slug emerged. The two slugs both flew into the sandstorm, fusing together which created a mega drill. The Armashelt and Crystalyd slug flew out from the Sandstorm and brutally ripped the innards of the Sand Leech into a thousand pieces and the blue blood of the Sand Leech splashed on the sandy ground. Ash was frozen in motion as she witnessed the Sand Leech falling to the ground with a loud thud. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&#39;re a dumbass, Thyst. I told you to be careful of the worms,&rdquo; Leia yelled as she approached Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s a Thyst if we aren&#39;t ruthless? Isn&#39;t that what I am?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You ain&#39;t wrong! But in all seriousness, you would&#39;ve been worm food,&rdquo; Leia laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just call me Ash. Thanks for that just then,&rdquo; Ash said. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s all good, girl! I also am heading for the ducts. Say, why don&#39;t we call a truce for now? Since you have no clue what&#39;s happening, I can fill you in on what is happening,&rdquo; Leia suggested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean? What do you mean what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Ash said, concerned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying, I&rsquo;ll explain to you who a Thyst is. The bloodline through the Empire is complicated and I&rsquo;ve seen it all,&rdquo; Leia explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? What about the bloodline?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Apparently, in the Southern Caverns, it&#39;s rumoured that 4 legendary djinns control life in the desert. Each major faction has one to maintain stability, but recently, the Emperor obtained two Djinns, trying to cure an illness of some sort. And that has caused chaos&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are these factions?&rdquo; Ash interrupted. They two started to slowly cross the worm territory as they kept talking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Renault Prime is one, their leader is Queen Viktria,&rdquo; Leia explained. &ldquo;Kahlos leads the Viridians and the relationship between the factions is complex. News travels weirdly around here&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash had a lot of new information to process. There were three clans that all hated each other and the emperor was to blame. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&#39;re here, the Ducts,&rdquo; Leia exclaimed. The Ducts was like a tapestry of pipes riddled with massive, rusted, metallic warehouses that were abandoned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The entrance was littered with trash and it was not at all welcoming. It reeked of an oil spillage as moss gathered around the base of the metallic walls. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get off your mech. That&#39;s rule one when you&#39;re in the Outback. If you do, you&#39;re asking to get robbed,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Ash asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. That&#39;s what Outcasts do. If they don&#39;t have a mech, they steal one,&rdquo; Leia described. As they entered the old rustic warehouse, industrial-like parts filled the walls. More pipes to strange beams connected the old infrastructure, barely holding the creaking walls up. Sound of water dripped from above and with each step their mechs took, a loud metallic echo roared through the narrow tunnels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&#39;re entering the underground caverns,&rdquo; Leia commented. Leia carefully reached into her slug storage and grabbed a Firenzar slug. &ldquo;Blazy, light the way!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What slug is that?&rdquo; Ash asked as the Firenzar lit up. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blazy is a Firenzar slug. It&#39;s a common slug that has decent power. Little Blazy is my favourite slug!&rdquo; Leia smiled. Blazy stood on the head of Leia&#39;s mech, marching forward slowly. They soon reached a sign with a wooden frame just after it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why does that sign say &lsquo;Caution: Evil Ahead&#39;?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s nothing. I&#39;ve been down here multiple times, trust me,&rdquo; Leia announced. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright then,&rdquo; Ash replied. The underground caverns were humid and claustrophobic, the air thick with the warm, coal-like scent of an ancient industry. Shallow pools of murky green water lined the narrow path, their still surfaces reflecting the dim glow of their mech&rsquo;s lights. The walls seemed to close in around them, dripping with moisture as they pressed deeper into the earth. Every step echoed faintly, the silence broken only by the occasional ripple in the water or the distant drip of unseen springs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Channels finally came into view as they turned the corner. The vast underground waterway bathed in the soft glow of bioluminescent algae had finally shown itself. Ash and Leia paused, awestruck by the eerie beauty of the place. But there was no time to linger. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thirsty Thyst?&rdquo; Leia asked. She pulled out a small cuboid-looking machine with a long transparent tube. Leia carefully lowered the tube into the water and it sucked in water. The water that was transferred through was filtered through the machine, making it drinkable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s cool,&rdquo; Ash commented. &ldquo;Wait, what&#39;s that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That?&rdquo; Leia asked, pointing her finger at a pair of magenta red eyes lurking above the water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s a croc right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Haha! You&#39;re half right!&rdquo; Leia laughed. &ldquo;That&#39;s a Tenasher slug!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The lurking crocodile-like slug waded through the water and hopped onto the bank, revealing its rainbow scales and cute appearance. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Woah&hellip;&rdquo; Ash gasped. Vinnie hopped out and greeted the slug, whispering to it. &ldquo;Jaws? Is that a good name?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You name your slugs?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, so?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing. That&#39;s quite nice, giving a nickname to slugs,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two continued down the path, finding an open area where the walls were gone and replaced by uneven stone walls. The air was much cooler and the scent of nature filled the small cave.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, is that another Tenasher slug?&rdquo; Ash pointed into the water as she drank from the vial that Leia lent her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s not a slug, that&#39;s a Bunyip! Run!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is a Bunyip?&rdquo; Ash yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bunyips are large reptilian creatures that feast on anything! They dwell in the waters and are extremely dangerous!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two jerked their mechs the other way but the Bunyip had leapt out of the water and slammed on the ground, blocking the exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Ash panicked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You use that Tenasher to distract the Bunyip. I&#39;ll get rid of this rubble!&rdquo; Leia ordered. Ash gracefully slung Jaws straight at the Bunyip. Jaws velocimorphed, turning into a menacing looking crocodile with razor sharp teeth. Jaws hurled itself with its scaly skin and knocked the humongous Bunyip back into the water. The Bunyip groaned in pain as it slowly got back up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; Leia had quickly used her Crystalyd to dig a hole through the debris, allowing the two to escape out of the channels.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash, that Tenasher slug of yours is gonna come in handy,&rdquo; Leia reiterated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, you&#39;re right! That move was so cool!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Anyways, what are you here for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m on a quest to find Maven&#39;s daughter&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait hold on, Daphne?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that Maven&#39;s daughter?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There was a short silence between the two as Leia questioned if helping Ash was the right choice. Leia slowly retreated her mech and beelined for the exit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&#39;re using me, aren&#39;t you? You guys captured Maven just a few weeks ago and you already know where his daughter is?&rdquo; Leia yelled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? What do you mean?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop trying to fool me. I know when someone tries to take advantage of me. Goodbye, Thyst,&rdquo; Leia turned around and dashed for the exit. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you again sometime&rsquo; farewell, this is goodbye,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Leia without hesitation fired a Hoprock slug causing the tunnels to slowly fall onto Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash reacted quickly and traversed the narrow tunnels until she reached an empty, small area enclosed with wooden frames and steel poles. Ash finally sighed in relief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Freeze!&rdquo; a voice echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I give up alright?&rdquo; Ash replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you? How did you find me?&rdquo; the voice asked sternly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you Daphne?&rdquo; Ash asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um, yes?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, Grayroad asked me to find you and to take you to his place. He is worried sick about you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll help you get out of this hellhole. Let&#39;s get to Grayroad&#39;s place then!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne and Ash returned to Grayroad&#39;s place safely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Welcome Daphne! How&#39;ve ya been?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey Grayroad!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daphne, I just need some help that&#39;s all,&rdquo; Grayroad requested. He signalled Daphne to his workbench with the blaster laid on the table. &ldquo;How do you wield the cryosphere magnet to the rest of the blaster?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne and Grayroad tinkered with the blaster for a while, for Ash it felt like all of eternity. Ash wandered aimlessly around the warehouse inspecting the various machines and tools that were scattered around the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blaster&#39;s ready!&rdquo; Grayroad announced. Ash hurriedly walked over to the bench to see the luxurious blaster with streaks of purple on the base. &ldquo;A Vixen MP27&hellip;A strong and flexible blaster,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash picked it up and toyed with it. She flicked the blaster up and the handle rotated with it and it formed into somewhat of a short sword. The bottom and top sides of the blaster were sharp, acting similar to a sword if it did come to close range fighting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s your last resort for when you don&#39;t have any slugs,&rdquo; Grayroad explained. &ldquo;It is hard to survive in the outback. The blaster edges will also help in daily chores,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks, but I have to go now,&rdquo; Ash said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Leaving already?&rdquo; Daphne exclaimed. &ldquo;Just stay here for a bit longer!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, but I have something important to do,&rdquo; Ash stepped out the door and hopped on her mech. The galloping sounds of her mech faded away while two new mechs approached the warehouse shortly after Ash&rsquo;s dismissal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne approached the door and opened it at the sound of loud knocking. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hello! I am down here! Not up there!&rdquo; Worlem shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, is Grayroad here? Also, nice seeing you here Daph,&rdquo; Lance asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yea, come on in!&rdquo; Daphne greeted. She warmly welcomed Lance and Worlem into the workshop where Grayroad was asleep in his chair.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sweet!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance hastily approached Grayroad who was sitting in a corner, looking at recent news on his huge monitor. Worlem stormed the warehouse with the curiosity of a cat and inspected all the machinery. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey Grayroad! Have you seen Ash?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? She was just here a moment ago! I thought you two were together, no?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That stupid mole ruined it for us. The mole&#39;s blaster got totaled by Ash because he had the cryosphere magnet,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, I&#39;ll fix it. You both better get her alright? Girls on the loose aren&#39;t the best thing in the world,&rdquo; Grayroad mumbled. He slowly stood up from his chair and bonked the mole&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&#39;s the remnants of the blaster?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who? Mine?&rdquo; Worlem asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who else do ya think I&#39;m talking to, ya flopperbrain?&rdquo; Grayroad shouted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eek!&rdquo; Worlem jumped back and handed over his broken blaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Well, this is easy. Gimme a couple minutes and I&#39;ll have this fixed,&rdquo; Grayroad smiled as he inspected the blaster. </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.31d1hz2d6j3b"><span class="c3">Chapter 5</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;&lsquo;Tis a piece of hot garbage!&rdquo; Grayroad exclaimed. &ldquo;I&#39;ll need something strong to stabilise the blaster, otherwise it&#39;ll blow your skull up!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eek!&rdquo; Worlem squealed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do ya need pops?&rdquo; Lance interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Can you and this stupid mole go to Rainbow Falls Cavern? Legend says you can get a Rainbow Scale from the Rainbow Serpent. That should fix this&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Or you can give him THAT blaster&hellip;&rdquo; Lance pointed at Ash&#39;s old blaster that she chucked into the corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eh? How&#39;s that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! My blaster is precious!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said use it temporarily while we go stupid mole!&rdquo; Lance exclaimed, rolling his eyes in disappointment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, if that&#39;s the case then, let&#39;s go!&rdquo; Worlem marched out of the warehouse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hold on a minute,&rdquo; Lance glared at the workbench that was tucked behind the furnace. &ldquo;She has the blaster, doesn&#39;t she?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes? What did you want me to do?&rdquo; Grayroad asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Lance said in a concerned tone. He hurriedly ran out the door and sped away on his mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Catch up to him mole,&rdquo; Grayroad laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! Come back here!&rdquo; Worlem yelled. He dashed out and followed Lance into the Outback. &ldquo;Lance! This is worm territory!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do I look like I&#39;m that dumb?&rdquo; Lance scoffed. A Sand Leech sprung out of the ground with its massive size, towering over the two as they sped across the terrain. &ldquo;Pfft, easy work,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance grabbed out his sniper and loaded Bingo in. With the perfect timing, Bingo ripped through the Sand Leech, instantly knocking it down. Worlem&#39;s eyes widened in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pretty easy huh?&rdquo; Lance grinned. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rainbow Falls Cavern was no secret place. The trademark of the Rainbow Waterfall had long gone with its vibrant colours. The stone surfaces, once smoothed by flowing streams, now stood dry and monotone, their grey and brown hues blending into a sombre, unvaried palette. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is this really Rainbow Falls Cavern?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, Worlem. It is,&rdquo; Lance explained. &ldquo;Careful of Hexlets,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance slowly made his way through the cavern, scaling the small mountains the cavern offered. Clusters of Mantarid, Desertooth and Hexlet slugs formed on the nearby plants, observing the two wander through the cavern. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So where&#39;s the serpent?&rdquo; Worlem was trembling with fear as they navigated through the dense vegetation of the cavern. Vines sprawled out of the almost dead trees, creating a mini jungle. Hexlets gazed at Worlem and the ever-growing feeling of something ominous watching them increased. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The hill led to a small cliff that overlooked the ghostly remnants of a once-mighty waterfall. From this vantage point, Lance and Worlem witnessed the scars left by the powerful cascade. Jagged rocks, now laid bare, bore the marks of countless years of erosion, their surfaces smoothed by the relentless flow that had long since vanished. A circle of tall hills surrounded the lake on 3 sides, creating a once nice scenic landscape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you two?&rdquo; a voice shouted from afar.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is someone&#39;s territory?&rdquo; Worlem shrieked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! Are you dumb?&rdquo; Lance yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Explain yourselves before I blast you to pieces!&rdquo; the voice echoed. The figure stepped out of the shadows, away from the trees, and approached Lance and Worlem with an Armashelt in her blaster. &ldquo;Oh, if it isn&#39;t the legend himself Lance Freeman,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you? Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you around here,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leia Fernux is the name. What are you here for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! Worlem exists here! Hello?&rdquo; Worlem shook his fist in the air, trying to grab Leia&#39;s attention but to no avail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, this little mole here needs a rainbow scale to fix his blaster,&rdquo; Lance explained. &ldquo;Isn&#39;t that right Worlem? Worlem?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the corner of Lance&#39;s eye, he saw Worlem on the track, heading down to the ground from the hill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem, no!&rdquo; Lance shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem marched to the dried banks of the lake, stepped out of his rugged wombat-like mech and made a bee-line for the centre of the lake. There it stood, glistening under the Solaryte crystals, a rainbow shard. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed as he snatched it forcefully. Deep underground, vibrations began to slowly climb through the earth, shaking the cracked basin. A loud roar followed and the ground erupted into thousands of pieces. Worlem ran for his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Lance asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t know. Just run! It&#39;s something bad!&rdquo; Leia exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What about Worlem?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Save your own life first Freeman!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance leapt from the cliff onto the small trail along the hill and swiftly made his way down near Worlem. At this point, a massive Rainbow Serpent had sprung out of the small hole majestically, glistening under the Solaryte crystals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rocks and debris had flown everywhere with a rather burnt earthy fragrance. The Serpent&#39;s iridescent scales shimmered with an ethereal glow, with each scale acting as a multifaceted crystal. They caught the light and refracted it into a dazzling spectrum of colours, casting vibrant hues across the arid landscape. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t moles like worms?&rdquo; Lance joked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The serpent&#39;s eyes, deep and hypnotic, glinted with an ancient intelligence and an insatiable hunger. As the Serpent sprawled out of the once-known lakebed, Worlem slowly retreated to his mech, preparing to make a run for it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The air seemed to vibrate with its presence, an aura of raw untamed power emanating from every inch of its formidable form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Run you fool!&rdquo; Lance yelled. Worlem scrambled to his mech, screaming in utter fear. The Rainbow Serpent was truly nothing but a blur of radiant light and razor-sharp crystals. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance slid beneath the serpent as it swung its large body at him. Still, at the edge of the cliff, Leia gazed down at the Rainbow Serpent. In her hand, she held a Hexlet slug that she had found lurking behind a small dead tree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey buddy, can you just do something?&rdquo; Leia asked nicely. She aimed the Hexlet at the serpent and it emitted an aura of bad luck onto it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you doing there Worlem?&rdquo; Lance yelled, frustrated. &ldquo;Shoot something!&rdquo; Worlem was terrified, shaking like a leaf, unloading a barrage of slugs. His arsenal was soon emptied with nothing but a mere Flopper left in his last shell. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m going to die! Oh, what bad luck I have!&rdquo; Worlem wailed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said we run!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two ran for their lives on their mechs with the serpent swooping down at them, right behind them. Desertooth and Mantarid slugs rushed behind the dense vegetation, hiding from the abomination of a beast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance quickly snatched a Mantarid slug that was escaping the chaos and loaded it up in his blaster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s now or never!&rdquo; Lance yelled, looking at Leia perched at the top of the cliff. Leia realised what Lance had planned. She hastily loaded a Desertooth slug that she had just plucked from a dead mushroom cap and fired it towards the chaotic mess. The Mantarid slug began to create a huge wave of sand that represented a tsunami. <br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance and Worlem quickly dodged the incoming slug and the tsunami, weaving gracefully through the narrow tunnel. The Desertooth slug flung off the wave and curled back towards the Rainbow Serpent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An onslaught of sharp and forceful jets of water shaped like thorns came out from the Desertooth and pressed onto the hard scales serpent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The serpent snapped and leached away, squirming all over the place from the high pressure water. The water pierced its scales and washed away its colour. The colour leaked slowly to the ground, restoring life and greenery to the corresponding patches of land. The serpent quickly went back and hid underground with no trace left behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Leia quickly sped down the hills and approached Lance and Worlem. Worlem looked particularly exhausted with sweat dripping from his forehead, panting like a dog on a scorching hot summer&#39;s day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You two okay?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am definitely not okay&hellip;&rdquo; Worlem sighed as he drooped his face into his mech, all tired. He laid there, almost asleep in the treacherous cavern. Lance gently tapped him on the shoulder, waking him up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;C&#39;mon, don&#39;t you want your blaster?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! My blaster!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed. His eyes lit up with excitement. Worlem lifted his chest high and revved his engine up and began to march back to the warehouse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You do have the scale, right?&rdquo; Lance asked. Worlem stopped dead in his tracks and searched his pockets, ultimately pulling out a small rainbow scale. It was intact and Worlem flexed it in front of Leia, smirking at the colourful shard that glistened under the beaming rays of the solaryte crystals.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I get it! You&#39;re Worlem the mighty!&rdquo; Leia blurted. Leia followed closely with Lance and Worlem back to the warehouse.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The crystal reflections dimmed low and the light cast onto the desert slowly faded. The three mechs slowly trudged through the sand, slowly making their way to the large gates to the warehouse. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Three knocks followed a large roar from Lance that echoed the name of Grayroad but to no avail. The door was still sealed shut with no sound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Leia asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daphne&#39;s in there. Hopefully this isn&#39;t trouble&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance drove his mech into the door, slamming it down. The doors violently swung open and two men stood in the way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I thought it was rude to enter without knocking&hellip;&rdquo; a brute murmured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No shit, Sherlock!&rdquo; the other shouted. &ldquo;What&#39;re ya three doin&rsquo; &lsquo;ere?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why are you two here? Who are you guys? Where&#39;s Grayroad?&rdquo; Lance yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You may know me as the Midnyte Doctor&hellip;&rdquo; Midnyte smirked. &ldquo;My partner, behold! Mordecai!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, Midnyte didn&#39;t hurt anyone,&rdquo; Mordecai grinned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! Anyways, I&#39;ll be taking my leave,&rdquo; Midnyte remarked. He took out a long staff and loaded a Chasm slug and teleported away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&#39;s Grayroad? Daphne?&rdquo; Worlem asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well look for them!&rdquo; Lance yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s all good! We&#39;re here!&rdquo; Daphne yelled from afar. Standing up and revealing themselves from the corner of the warehouse, Grayroad approached Worlem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem carefully took out the Rainbow Shard and offered Grayroad the piece. Grayroad, angry, forcefully snatched the shard away, scaring Worlem once again. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now bugger off!&rdquo; Grayroad yelled. He isolated himself at the workstation and got to fixing Worlems&#39;s blaster. Soon after, the blaster was fixed. Worlem thanked Grayroad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No payment?&rdquo; Grayroad demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Worlem whimpered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, he almost died getting that shard. Surely you let him have this one on you right?&rdquo; Lance interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ugh, fine. You are a filthy animal. But keep doing what you are doing. Down with the emperor!&rdquo; Grayroad chanted. Lance and Leia had refuelled their mechs and were ready to continue the journey. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daphne!&rdquo; Lance called out. &ldquo;Come with us!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne ran out the door, all ecstatic. &ldquo;Joining the three of you on a journey? Count me in!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, the best part, you can ride on Worlem&#39;s mech!&rdquo; Lance laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Worlem shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s ok, I have a mech! It&#39;s just all the way back at the ducts. Dad left it there, if we could get it, we could really kick some ass!&rdquo; Daphne smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright then, The Ducts is where we go!&rdquo; Leia exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Bye Grayroad! I&#39;ll be back before you know it!&rdquo; Daphne waved at Grayroad as the four began to ride into the distance. Grayroad smiled, waved back and went back inside the warehouse. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Those two bandits. They took my prized possession, a sapphire crystal! This isn&#39;t real. If they give it to the emperor, the situation will not be in our favour. It can only be down to Ash. We must beat the emperor,&rdquo; Grayroad thought. He knew there was an inescapable war that was coming that nobody could stop.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.vgztol671xcg"><span class="c3">Chapter 6</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The maroon sand crackled under the Solaryte crystals. The windswept valleys carried the dust across the jaded castle, the throne of Renault Prime. There, a sweet angelic hum would echo through the barren landscape. It was said that the Ohminah slug would sing at sunrise and control the mountain range.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Midnyte and Mordecai?&rdquo; Queen Viktria demanded. Queen Viktria was influential, if not the most influential person in the Southern Caverns as her empire was built with one of the most powerful djinns, the Ohminah slug. Embedded into the valleys of the Eastern Uplands, the empire was always at a tactical advantage by seizing the high ground and taking cover from the valley. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on their way back, Your Majesty,&rdquo; the guard replied. Still hazy from the scorching hot weather, the guard waddled out of her room. Mordecai and Midnyte were still far away, on their way back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Also, is it true a new Thyst has arrived?&rdquo; Queen Viktria asked, her frown turning into an evil smile.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. Do you want me to take care of her? Make sure that the emperor has no heirs to the throne?&rdquo; a voice beamed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Queen Viktria&rsquo;s expression widened, now grinning with joy. She smiled wickedly and cackled. &ldquo;If you want. She seems&hellip;inexperienced,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well&hellip;&rdquo; the voice replied. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Maxor, one more thing. Dark water.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, Your Majesty,&rdquo; Maxor mumbled, then chuckling as he left the room. Maxor was the Queen&rsquo;s bodyguard and was a renowned Slugslinger, able to withstand the powerful abilities of the djinn, Ohminah. The Queen had plans to finally capture and use the djinn to win the war.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash had been roaming the caverns for a while. She had found a few smaller towns, none close to the size of Steamvale. The dusty environment finally led her to the town of Clinkton, a small but busy town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Vinnie, stay hidden alright? I think you attract a little too much attention,&rdquo; Ash cautioned, finally realising maybe that her slug was too distinctive, allowing people to identify her as a Thyst.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The locals hurried from building to building, carrying baskets of what seemed to be food. Ash was curious and Vinnie couldn&#39;t help but peek to see what the commotion was about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me, but what&#39;s happening around here?&rdquo; Ash asked politely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Outsiders, eh?&rdquo; the lady asked. &ldquo;We don&#39;t get outsiders here often, but it&#39;s nice to see a new face. It&#39;s the queen&#39;s birthday tomorrow so tonight we have this celebratory dinner! We are preparing a feast and since the town is small, we figured to have it at our church.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Church?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, church! Renault Prime all pray upon our god, the Ohminah slug! Sometimes it will bring a storm, where water fills our artificial water storage areas,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash was amazed by this information, a slug that could bring water to the people. The slug was like a god for the people and Ash had never expected Renault Prime to praise it so much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why don&#39;t you come join us?&rdquo; the lady suggested. It was getting late and Ash was hungry, so she couldn&#39;t deny the offer. Ash eagerly accepted and followed the lady to the church where it had been adjusted to fit a large table. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Praise Queen Viktria! Long live the Queen!&rdquo; the people chanted. Amongst the table, 3 cave trolls sat together on one end. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The feast was spectacular, with delicious foods that Ash had never tasted before. The steamed leech meat glistened under the chandelier overhead, the juices overflowing. As she chewed down the tender meat, the flavours exploded in her mouth. She had never tasted such umami like this ever before, it was enchanting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The feast ended with loud chattering amongst the townsfolk, laughter filling the interior of the church. The residents soon filed out, with the solaryte crystals dimming in brightness overhead. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, thanks for the meal,&rdquo; Ash complimented, feeling extremely full. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No worries, feel free to come back anytime!&rdquo; the lady replied, smiling. Ash felt the town was nice, and that Renault Prime maybe wasn&#39;t as bad as she heard. From stories from other towns, the queen was depicted as greedy and arrogant while the kingdom of Renault Prime was portrayed as a corrupt empire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Maybe, just maybe Ash had to pay a visit to the capital city, Murzengof. And she did begin, having to first navigate through the infamous Funnelweb Cavern, the abandoned cemetery for Renault Prime. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Funnelweb Cavern wasn&#39;t just an abandoned cemetery, it was also a complicated labyrinth, home to the arachnids that dwelled in the tunnels. The arachnids would burrow the bodies of the dead deep beneath the cavern, preserving their bodies in webs to show respect. It seemed all horrifying but Ash knew she had to cross the cavern to reach Murzengof, where the castle of Renault Prime stood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her mech&#39;s mechanical legs carefully weaved through the webs of the cavern, each step sending quiet vibrations into the earth. The entrance was already haunting enough, with tombstones littered like the leaves scattered by the autumn wind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The cavern was much cooler than the rest of the caverns, with more of a clinical atmosphere. It sent shivers down Ash&#39;s spine, and she felt like a pair of eyes was watching her every move. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Shadows darted around the darkened corners of the cavern roof, staying out of Ash&#39;s sight. The arachnids had spotted her. A slight hiss rang in Ash&#39;s ear and she suddenly jerked away, now becoming even more cautious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who&#39;s there?&rdquo; she demanded, Vinnie now hopping onto her shoulder. A claw suddenly shot towards her, a sharp pincer attempting to pinch her into a thousand pieces. Vinnie reacted quickly, slowing time down allowing Ash to swiftly dodge the attack. Regaining her composure, Ash repositioned herself in a much more open area of the tunnel, avoiding the tunnel walls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">An umber shell appeared from the darkness, the glowshrooms illuminating a crimson body that the shell hid. It was a scorpion, its claws large and deadly. Its bladed legs and coiled tail aimed at Ash, ready to pounce on her with its venomous touch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash saw its six burning eyes, pierced the void, locking onto her with an insatiable hunger. She panicked, feeling for a capsule on her belt. She tried loading a slug into her blaster, but the scorpion easily knocked her blaster out of her hands. Now unarmed, it felt like the end.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The scorpion dived on Ash and Ash jumped off her mech quickly, barely dodging the ominous claws. She reached for her blaster, now rearmed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Arachnet, Mandimesh and Taranticle slugs perched upon nearby glowshrooms, watching the action unfold. The innocent creatures stood there in awe and watched Ash fight the scorpion back, chuckling a bit in the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, can someone please help me?&rdquo; Ash asked, her eyes now darting around and seeing the slugs gathering and watching her. She now was even more pressured at the sight of more eyes watching her, not knowing what to do. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">However, a Mandimesh slug confidently hopped towards Ash, jumping into a free capsule. It felt unreal, seeing a slug wanting to help and Ash was extremely pleased to see at least a slug was willing to help her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash loaded the slug into her blaster instantly and fired at the scorpion, hoping the slug would do something. The Mandimesh slug quickly velocimorphed, unleashing its attack. Two large mandibles appeared and it quickly crushed the opposing scorpion, clamping it down. It was squashed easily, the slug&#39;s power dominating the feeble scorpion&#39;s strength.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; Ash exclaimed as she watched the Mantimesh defeat the scorpion with ease. The slug landed on the dead scorpion&#39;s body, mocking and laughing. Nearby Arachnet and Taranticle slugs joined in as well, playing with the corpse of the scorpion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash was uncomfortable as the slugs played with the corpse, &nbsp;feasting on the scorpion&#39;s meat. It felt unnatural but in these conditions, this was necessary in order to survive the harsh conditions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A Taranticle hopped towards Ash, presenting its sepia body proudly. It waved at her and Vinnie jumped down, greeting the new slug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi little buddy! You wanna join my team?&rdquo; Ash asked gently, reaching her hand out. The Taranticle jumped up and down ecstatically, then jumped into her palm. &ldquo;You&#39;re an energetic fella aren&#39;t you? Well, let&#39;s see what you can do!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash loaded her newly found slug into her blaster and fired the slug out. Reaching velocimorph form, the slug transformed into a beastly tarantula with octopus-like tentacles, firmly gripping on to the nearby rocks. Its tentacles then extended, easily ripping the stones that filled a hole in the tunnels revealing an exit, into a new area. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash&rsquo;s eyes lit up, jumping up on her mech and riding through. The Taranticle returned to Ash and they continued on with their journey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, what do you think of the nickname Spooda?&rdquo; Ash chuckled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The cavern led to a towering cliff, overlooking a humongous canyon. Just over the horizon, Ash spotted the top of the castle and immediately she knew she was close to the headquarters of Renault Prime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Ash approached a small path that led down the cliff to the bottom of the canyon, she heard a deafening scream; a scream that sounded like it came from a slug. Just what was happening? Ash quickly rushed over on her mech, finding two men capturing a helpless slug. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! Stop right there! What do you think you are doing with that slug?&rdquo; Ash yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m saving it,&rdquo; the masked figure remarked, holding down a button on the metal base of the glass capsule. A red smoke filled the capsule, then infused into the slug. As the smoke faded, the slug let out a screech, now with a menacing crimson aura. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&hellip;did you just do it?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I made it better&hellip;This Ohminous slug is now mine&hellip;&rdquo; the masked man exclaimed. &ldquo;And who exactly are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My name? I&#39;m not telling you!&rdquo; Ash growled. Vinnie popped out curious, but the masked man immediately recognized the slug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thyst? Well if I&#39;ll be damned. I&#39;ve been looking for you for ages!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Your grandfather is waiting for you&hellip;&rdquo; the masked man mumbled. &ldquo;And my name is Kilbert. Remember that,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He loaded his newly made ghoul into his staff-like blaster, shooting it towards the sky. The slug ascended quickly, then tore the cliffs apart instantly like a flashing lightning strike, creating a direct path to the castle walls. The sandy cliffs were now piles of ash and a burnt scent emerged from the remnants. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;Ah, I hope the Queen welcomes us&hellip;Let&#39;s go Thyst,&rdquo; Kilbert snickered. Ash was scared. Just who was Kilbert?</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.itrpn2prvk5x"><span class="c3">Chapter 7</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&#39;re under attack!&rdquo; Queen Viktria announced. &ldquo;Where&#39;s Midnyte and Mordecai?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ll deal with them. It seems that our djinn has been seized by the Emperor&#39;s forces,&rdquo; Maxor grumbled as he threw the containers of dark water onto the ground.. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You must hurry!&rdquo; the Queen exclaimed, handing Maxor a Spasm and Negablade slug. &ldquo;Take these, grab the djinn and send him to the void!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Will do, your majesty,&rdquo; said Maxor, adjusting his blaster to shoot a fusion shot. Maxor swiftly ran towards the outer city that surrounded the castle and saw the chaos, just two solitary figures standing motionless at the newly carved out tunnel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As he gazed upon the city, he retracted his blaster and put it back into single mode, thinking maybe it was easier to knock the enemies out. He was confident in his skill to take out his enemies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash, let&#39;s take this stupid faction out,&rdquo; Kilbert laughed, equipping the Ohminous slug again. &ldquo;This time, I&#39;ll flatten the whole castle!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Kilbert aimed the Ohminous slug towards the castle, Maxor came rushing down with a Doomspiker, knocking Kilbert&#39;s staff away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? You have ghouls too?&rdquo; Kilbert shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We got our suppliers,&rdquo; Maxor shouted angrily, now loading in an Attacknet slug. &ldquo;A Thyst as well? The queen will be pleased!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cover me Ash!&rdquo; Kilbert yelled as he dove for his staff. Ash questioned her choices, then realised that Kilbert didn&rsquo;t actually mind her being around. Maybe Kilbert was on her side, so she maximorphed Vinnie without hesitation while Maxor released the attacknet, aiming for Kilbert. Vinnie tapped the Attacknet, freezing her in time while she continued her path to freeze Kilbert. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Tempora&hellip;I can&#39;t beat it&hellip;&rdquo; Maxor realised, eyes widening at the sight of the hazel and lavender streaks speeding towards him. Maxor was frozen in time now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kilbert reaching his blaster now unleashed the Ohminous slug from the capsule, completely flattening the city of Murzengof and knocking Maxor onto his back. Time resumed for Maxor and his slug. The Attacknet missed. The residents were screaming and running from the chaos. It seemed to be over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;You monsters!&rdquo; Maxor grumbled in pain. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are these floppers?&rdquo; a voice chirped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;More flopper brains?&rdquo; another added. Two shadowy figures emerged from the large opening the Ohminous slug created. Their voices were familiar for Maxor and he realised it was Midnyte and Mordecai. They were back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Kilbert growled. Ash stepped back, scared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&#39;ve messed with the wrong faction!&rdquo; Midnyte exclaimed, holding out the sapphire crystal, instantly attracting the Ohminous slug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Where did you find that?&rdquo; Kilbert yelled. Ash was so confused at what was happening. Who was this Midnyte and Mordecai person? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks for ghouling it, saves us the dark water needed!&rdquo; Mordecai added, laughing. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Kilbert shouted, firing a grimstone. Mordecai quickly deflected it by firing a Frostfang, freezing the Grimstone in flight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Kilbert yelled, now angry. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s a Thyst! Let&#39;s get her!&rdquo; Midnyte exclaimed, pointing at the Tempora slug that hopped on Ash&#39;s shoulder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Screw you!&rdquo; Ash yelled, firing Spooda. Spooda velocimorphed, then used its fierce tentacles to swiftly push the two away. Ash ran to her mech, quickly running away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Floppers! We let her get away!&rdquo; Midnyte exclaimed, rubbing his head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;At least we got Kilbert! We have another djinn&hellip;The Queen will be pleased&hellip;&rdquo; Mordecai replied, shaking the sand out of his silver hair. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&hellip;what are you going to do with me?&rdquo; Kilbert groaned, surrounded by the three Renault Prime members. Maxor now back on his feet aimed his Doomspiker at Kilbert&#39;s face, threatening him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To the dungeons probably,&rdquo; Mordecai implied, &ldquo;You&#39;re gonna tell us everything the emperor plans&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That flopper brain of a Thyst! She betrayed the emperor even though she&#39;s her granddaughter!&rdquo; Kilbert yelled, smashing his fist into the sandy ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, she saved herself!&rdquo; Midnyte mocked, laughing at Kilbert&rsquo;s defeat. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky I didn&rsquo;t need to use the fusion&hellip;&rdquo; Maxor grumbled, giving Kilbert a menacing side-eye. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Meanwhile, Ash was long gone, already riding away from Murzengof. She thought to herself, </span><span class="c7 c8">granddaughter</span><span class="c2">? What was the Emperor&rsquo;s relationship with her? She didn&rsquo;t believe Kilbert, though he did actually support and help her. Was going to the Emperor&rsquo;s place actually a good idea? She had so many questions in her mind that she couldn&rsquo;t think straight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Soon, she ended up riding into Spring Cavern, which was like an oasis that sat along the edge of the desert. It had water and most of all some shelter, so Ash decided to camp there for the rest of the night. It was late, the Solaryte crystals did not radiate any light. It felt like midnight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright guys, sleep well,&rdquo; Ash smiled, leaning upon her mech as some sort of headrest. It felt hard and for a moment, it felt like the world was against her.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.wkckrroftc3h"><span class="c3">Chapter 8</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance, Leia, Daphne and Worlem were now finally grouped up. Although the gang was a rather odd bunch, one being an outcast, another being a mole, another an engineer and another sniper, the four seemed good on paper, at least.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Ducts were their first goal, and to retrieve Daphne&#39;s mech from the Channels where she had sheltered before. Worlem never liked the idea that Daphne was to ride on his mech, and made a large fuss about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No! My mech is state of the art, only my buttocks can rest on it!&rdquo; Worlem demanded, nudging Daphne away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ugh, you&#39;re ridiculous&hellip;&rdquo; Leia remarked, rolling her eyes in frustration. Leia warmly invited Daphne to ride on her mech for the journey to the Ducts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem shrugged it off and followed his own opinions. It was silent for a large portion of the trip.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you sure this is the right way Worlem?&rdquo; Lance finally asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Never question the scent of a mole! This is a shortcut!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed, marching ahead of the group. Worlem led the way proudly, his mech having an autopilot mode that allowed him to take a few naps on their journey. Indeed their trip to the Ducts was treacherous, needing to cross Worm territory multiple times, but Worlem was unfazed and was carefree about his surroundings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Soon, the saturated orange sand faded monotone, with metal scraps becoming more evident around them. They were close. Daphne felt familiar with the surroundings and Leia was grossed out. She had been here already in the past few days and the last thing she wanted was to get herself dirty in the Channels again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed, reaching the metallic mess of the ducts. Lance decided to not go inside the ducts as he was claustrophobic and stayed outside, while Daphne and Worlem went in. Leia accompanied Lance outside, watching for any potential danger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Why do I have to go with her?&rdquo; Worlem complained, not wanting to go inside the ducts. It was cold and scary as Worlem tried to argue, but Lance and Leia didn&rsquo;t budge. Worlem finally agreed and slowly trudged down the murky tunnels that lead to Daphne&rsquo;s old hiding spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem took from his capsules a Firenzar slug, lighting the way. Daphne sat behind Worlem on his mech and the two navigated the Channels with ease. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you sure it is this way?&rdquo; Worlem asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, keep going and turn right at the end,&rdquo; Daphne instructed. &ldquo;I&#39;ve lived here for weeks,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem was skeptical but Daphne&#39;s voice was firm, ordering Worlem around. He was scared and didn&#39;t want to get eaten, so he listened, his eyes widened at all times in pure terror.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they crossed the algae infested tunnels, faint red eyes peeked out from the goopy waters and stared at Worlem. It felt nauseating for him, but Daphne reassured him. &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, they are Tenasher slugs, they don&#39;t bite,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem&#39;s Glowbyss hopped out from its capsule, joining the Firenzar on the hood of his mech. It also lit up the way, but also attracted a horde of Tenasher slugs, also jumping up onto the hood of his mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Glowbyss slugs live around here too, they are just much rarer!&rdquo; Daphne chuckled. Worlem was still worried that the Tenasher slugs would chomp his mech in half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Still, he remained stoic and unfazed, marching onwards. Soon, they arrived at an opening. There was an old wooden door and Daphne hopped off. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My mech&#39;s in there. I&#39;ll be back!&rdquo; Daphne waved. The Firenzar slug hopped back onto Daphne, following her to retrieve her mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem sighed, sitting there on his mech alone with his Glowbyss slug happily playing with the Tenasher slugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne entered her old hideout, full of useless junk and her mech. The candle was still lit somehow even after a few days, barely illuminating the earthy mess that engulfed the room. Hidden under a cloth in the corner of the room was her mech, still in one stable piece. She quickly started it and returned to Worlem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&#39;s get outta here!&rdquo; Daphne exclaimed as she patted the dust of her mech. Her mech was shaped like an Emu, with stripes of blue and brown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Lance and Leia stood outside, waiting patiently. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s up with you, Freeman?&rdquo; Leia asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That flopper brain of a mole&hellip;&rdquo; Lance muttered. His expression was bleak, and to Leia, she saw that he was depressed. Though Lance depicted his usual stoic behaviour, Leia saw straight through his facade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He said something he shouldn&#39;t have&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I was so close to getting the rebellion to work. We would&#39;ve had a Thyst on our side,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You mean that girl with the Tempora and all that?&rdquo; Leia was shocked that she could barely piece together her sentence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, she doesn&#39;t know anything about her legacy. Probably from the burning world,&rdquo; Lance explained. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean&hellip;I feel bad for her now that you put it this way&hellip;&rdquo; Leia replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;RUN!&rdquo; a voice yelled. Lance&#39;s eyes darted behind to find Worlem and Daphne rushing out of the Ducts, being chased by a creature. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A Bunyip has been ghouled somehow! There must&#39;ve been a dark water leak somewhere down there!&rdquo; Daphne shouted. Worlem was screaming in terror, speeding away first. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance and Leia quickly jumped back onto their mechs. The ghouled Bunyip was ferocious, it was determined to capture Worlem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the flopper?&rdquo; Leia shouted, puzzled by the ruthless Bunyip. The mechanical walls had collapsed, and the Bunyip crashed out into the desert. Perched on its back, a handful of Gloombyss and Menasher slugs stood ominous. The Bunyips&#39; powerful legs thrusted its body forwards, its deadly tail ready to propel the slugs that sat on its back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The dark water must&#39;ve gotten into the Channels! The slugs are all ghouled!&rdquo; Daphne exclaimed, giving Lance a worried glare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; Worlem panicked. The Menasher slugs quickly velocimorphed, chasing down the gang with their blood red jaws. The loud, painful crunching of their saw like teeth was horrifying, edging ever so closer to their mechs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The sight of them was menacing enough, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that Gloombyss slugs followed their rage, velocimorphing into benders of light. The Gloombyss slugs shot out a concentrated beam of light, forcing the gang to swerve and dodge in uncomfortable ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s not going to stop!&rdquo; Leia exclaimed, her eyes darting back to see the Bunyip hot on their tails with an insatiable hunger for them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was like an indomitable force that chased relentlessly, and Lance had no clue on how to beat it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leia, do you have a fusion blaster?&rdquo; Lance shouted through the loud galloping of their mechs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s the plan?&rdquo; Leia replied, grabbing her blaster.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem, can I borrow your Glowbyss?&rdquo; Lance asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What for!?&rdquo; Worlem squirmed, pressing down his accelerator pedal with as much force as he could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Just gimme!&rdquo; Lance snatched. Lance swiftly tossed the Glowbyss slug to Leia, instructing her what to do next. &ldquo;Do you still have that Hexlet? I&#39;m not sure if this fusion will work, but it&#39;s our only chance!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gotcha!&rdquo; Leia assured, charging the fusion shot up. Pulling the trigger, the two slugs synergised, fusing together and created a blinding white light that exploded behind them. The group pressed on their breaks and stopped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are we good?&rdquo; Daphne asked, catching her breath.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance wiped the sweat that gathered on his forehead and stepped off his mech. &ldquo;Saw this in a movie once. Slugs in Black I think was the name&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, you mean the Neuralyzer thing?&rdquo; Leia suggested, grinning with pleasure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, that! The Hexlet surely will make that stupid Bunyip forget, right?&rdquo; Lance added. As the dust scattered away and the faint white light settled, the path behind them was clear and the Bunyip was nowhere in sight. They had chased it away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank god&hellip;we would&#39;ve been slug food!&rdquo; Worlem sighed, his body sinking into his mech of exhaustion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem, where are we?&rdquo; Lance asked, jumping back onto his mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem jerked upright, scratched his head and sniffed the air. &ldquo;Strange scent&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Daphne asked, pulling out a device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s that Daph?&rdquo; Leia asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This? This is a digital map. I&#39;ll check where we are!&rdquo; Daphne giggled, using her fingers to pan across the screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! That&#39;s cheating!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed angrily, flailing his fist around.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Crysilis Cavern is up ahead!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I knew that!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed, marching forth. The rest followed, heading into Crysilis Cavern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Crysilis Cavern&hellip;My favourite&hellip;&rdquo; Leia whispered to herself. Her Crystalyd slug hopped on the hood of her mech, standing proudly and humming a soft tune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">From the veins of citrine gems and pillars of peridot and amber, Amythistle and Refracent slugs peeped out, mesmerised by the Crystalyd&#39;s tune.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice Crystalyd,&rdquo; Lance remarked, his speedstinger watching in awe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Leia replied, looking around at the slugs that peeped out. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Say, are the crystals supposed to be grey?&rdquo; Worlem raised, slowing down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stop slowing down! You&#39;re jamming the path for everyone!&rdquo; Daphne yelled, frustrated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, the dark water is spreading even up to here&hellip;&rdquo; Lance noticed, inspecting the decayed rocks. The crystals up ahead had lost its colour, the vibrant palette of the once bright gemstones were now dissipated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, that&#39;s a Cryscada slug&hellip;&rdquo; Leia exclaimed in terror, realising the destruction the dark water was causing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&#39;t get me started on those Omithistles and Necracents&hellip;&rdquo; Lance began.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Worlem&hellip;has never seen these slugs before&hellip;Eek!&rdquo; Worlem squealed, ducking down into his mech.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Amithistles and Omithistles are the gem shard slugs, they shoot out high velocity gem shards. The ghoul variant allows the shards to explode, if I recall properly&hellip;&rdquo; Daphne recited.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ve seen someone use a Necracent slug on me once&hellip;It&#39;s not fun&hellip;&rdquo; Lance added. &ldquo;Refracent and Necracent slugs can copy moves&hellip;Only that the ghoul can reflect twice as much damage&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Perhaps I can suggest a different route?&rdquo; whimpered Worlem, his voice squeaking as a slight smile formed. Lance nodded and quickly turned away, avoiding the ghouled cavern. Just exactly what was happening?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Daphne, you got the brains, do you know why this is happening?&rdquo; Lance asked curiously, giving her the look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Daphne shook her head in disappointment, then pieced together her words. &ldquo;I&#39;m uncertain, but the legend says that if the djinns are ghouled, the caverns slowly decay&hellip;But that&#39;s only if the Kinderling djinn is ghouled&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A Witherling!&rdquo; Worlem shrieked, his body shaking at the mention of the name. &ldquo;I&#39;ve heard stories that it took away life from whoever came close&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Save your stories for another day,&rdquo; Lance mocked, leading the way out of Crysilis Cavern. The exit was narrow, the walls riddled with gemstones, those that were decaying and those that were not.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are we now?&rdquo; Worlem questioned, sniffing the air. The exit had led them to an unknown intersection that divided the desert. </span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.5ke37kwxr2k"><span class="c3">Chapter 9</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was common knowledge that Crysilis Cavern housed some of the most beautiful and elegant slugs in all of the Southern Caverns, the majestic magenta Amithistle and the quartz white Refracent slugs. Their luxurious appearances easily dazzled and outshined the other slugs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yet, less know about the darker or murky secret of Crysilis Cavern. While the gemstones in the cavern did shine bright, it undermined the simple nature of the cavern, with these large pillars of gems shifting into strange positions, creating new paths to unexplored areas. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was so bizarre that many people who had entered the cavern had never made it back out to tell the story. It was all said for every explorer to go missing in the very intricate tunnels of the cavern and get lost behind a wall of fine peridot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There was no pattern or any indication on how these gemstones moved, but Lance knew that for a fact, they had entered one of these. The shaft had led to a jungle like area, with lush flora and water. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s just a mirage!&rdquo; Worlem cried, hitting his head as if he was stuck in a nightmare. The shrubs tickled his legs, only increasing Worlem&#39;s fear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, this isn&#39;t a mirage. We&#39;ve just travelled up north enough,&rdquo; Daphne explained. &ldquo;The closer we get to the Great Barrier Walls, the more lush it is!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, the only place with drinkable water&hellip;&rdquo; Lance sighed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t it also home to Gyrophyll and Chlorobite slugs?&rdquo; Leia added, checking her mechanical device. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; Worlem remarked. Worlem once again, though scared, led the group and attempted to head South, back towards Steamvale. The jungle wasn&rsquo;t explored as much, even though it had the natural resources for life to thrive. Many people viewed the jungle as some dangerous territory, protected by the Viridians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yet, nobody knew who or what the Viridians were. They lurked in the jungle for some strange reason. In a distant glade, Lance and the group took a break to actually question where they really were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; a stern voice breached. The dense vines that cloaked the jungle rustled, and a large, blue cave troll emerged from the shadows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A cave troll!&rdquo; Worlem exclaimed, slowly widening his mouth in surprise. No one had ever seen a cave troll for a long time and it was only ever a myth that before the Emperor, the cave trolls controlled the Southern Caverns.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you trespassers doing in our territory?&rdquo; The cave troll looked menacing, his gaze striking fear into the gang, especially Worlem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance carefully approached the armored cave troll. The cave troll loomed over Lance and stared him down, then Lance finally pieced together his words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&#39;re sorry for trespassing, we got lost navigating Crysilis Cavern and ended up here&hellip;&rdquo; Lance apologised, not thinking much about the cavern.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Crysilis Cavern? I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve seen the decaying, right?&rdquo; said the cave troll. He was surprised, but also intrigued by how these people weren&#39;t sent by the emperor. He could easily tell by their kindness and fear towards him so he calmed down and introduced himself. &quot;My name is Blute, and I&#39;ve been tasked to find the djinn around here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There&#39;s a djinn around here?&rdquo; Daphne interrupted, now eager to learn more about the djinn that resided in the jungle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, that&#39;s what Kahlos says. He says the legendary djinn, the Uggmite slug may be around here. We have to act fast, since the withering is spreading to the jungle. As I was patrolling around, I saw some of the Chlorobite and Gyrophyll slugs turn into their ghoul forms, Chlorofight and Pyrokill!&rdquo; Blute exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, we better hurry!&rdquo; Lance exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The group followed Blute back into the jungle, weaving through the swampy terrain. The mud was soft and their mech&rsquo;s legs were quickly messed up with the dirty brown stains that etched into the metal plating. Blute led the group, humming a slight tune when suddenly, he broke the silence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Blute signalled, pulling back the vines that cloaked the city. The city was embedded into the jungle as if the cave trolls had been living in the large trees, making the city almost feel fantasy-like. Apart from the otherworldliness of the flora infested city, a figure approached Blute, another cave troll. It was quite obvious that it was their leader as Lance saw the intricate patterns that were etched into his armor, with golden shoulder pads and a green badge of some sort.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their leader stepped up to the group and inspected them, making sure they weren&rsquo;t spies. Blute casually nudged him away, ensuring that the group was safe from doing any espionage here. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Kahlos, they tryna help with the withering&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t know! About two hundred years ago today, the Emperor took our land&hellip;&rdquo; Kahlos growled. His voice sounded disarming, yet there was an unmistakable edge of fury beneath it, a simmering rage held back only by years of restraint. &ldquo;He took away the green, the flora and fauna! The desert formed at his arrival. Us cave trolls have to reside here, away from the Emperor,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Out of the group, Daphne was the most dazzled by the spectacular sight of the city. To her it felt like an engineering feat with mechanical looking buildings with complex machinery. She was eager to explore, and obviously to climb the trees of the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you mind if we take a quick tour around the city?&rdquo; Daphne asked, her voice bubbling with excitement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kahlos laughed and motioned towards the path. &ldquo;Of course! Blute will treat ya at our great bar!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Blute happily led the group down to a lake-side hut, its roof made of straw giving it a Pacific vibe. The atmosphere was very calming, and there, Leia saw Aquabeeks playing joyfully in the lake. The slugs were adorable, her expression melted into a gentle smile that gazed upon them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Blute! Great to see ya!&rdquo; the bartender exclaimed, walking out from the back wiping down a glass. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;5 pineapple mixers and a mango salad!&rdquo; Blute announced. He threw a few gold coins on the counter and the bartender quickly gathered it up, storing them away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Outsiders?&rdquo; the bartender asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Got a problem?&rdquo; Lance replied defensively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nope. Just rare to see Outsiders who aren&#39;t trying to kill us. Name&#39;s Goldof,&rdquo; Goldof chuckled. He gracefully mixed the drinks with a flourish, handing each one out to the customers. He then slid out a few trays, filled with slug food. &ldquo;Nutritious and tasty&hellip;For the slugs!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance, Leia, Daphne and Worlem&#39;s slugs all hopped out and joined in on the feast, munching away at the tropical delicacies the Viridi City offered. It was truly luscious green.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then there was a muffled bang, followed by a faint scent of smoke that drifted through the leaves and down towards the bar. Something was not right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We got someone firing Pyrokills!&rdquo; Kahlos shouted, running towards the bar. Blute jerked up, then immediately ran towards the exit preparing to battle. His angered expression cracked through, gripping his blaster tightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&#39;s go!&rdquo; Lance commanded, leading the group towards the action. Lance knew that he had to help, with how the cave trolls were almost extinct, he couldn&#39;t resist the urge of treating this discovery as a vacation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The group followed tightly and jumped on their mechs, speeding through the jungle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Worlem chuckled as he snagged a Chlorobite slug that perched on a nearby leaf.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Blute roared, a volley of red hot balls shooting towards the group. Worlem shrieked, then bolted quickly towards the left into a bush, avoiding the attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the heck is that?&rdquo; Daphne yelled, barely dodging the attack. The balls slowly retracted, forming a large centipede like slug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s the Pyrokill! Where&#39;s the user?&rdquo; Blute panicked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; a voice called, firing a Strikeshade slug. The sharp needles rained down like droplets of water, casually piercing the natural flora. Each spike that took impact created a dark spot of withering, quickly making the surrounding trees that acted as cover into mere ashes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A ghouled Spikeshade?&rdquo; Worlem questioned, peeking out of the bush and revealing himself. &ldquo;There&#39;s only one man I know!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem chuckled for once as he knew Spikeshade slugs extremely well, firing a flopper to tank the next slug. As expected, Worlem perfectly predicted the Spikeshade, allowing him to prepare the Chlorobite slug for maximorph. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aha! Fall off your mech!&rdquo; Worlem snickered. The Chlorobite instantly obliterated the surrounding greenery, shredding it with its now enormous claws, revealing the enemy&rsquo;s location. The figure&#39;s eyes widened with pure terror.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Chlorobite slug flew towards him, aiming its venomous stringer at his head. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Bang!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Chlorobite slug was suddenly knocked away, swatted away like a fly. A more menacing Chlorofight appeared, with crimson streaks soaring through the sky. The Chlorofight quickly directed its sharp claws at Worlem.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Leia shouted, firing her Firenzar slug. The flames quickly scorched the leafy armor of the ghoul, returning it to protoform. Leia&rsquo;s Firenzar didn&#39;t stop there, it continued its path and sent an inferno ring towards the sniper that perched high to deflect Worlem&#39;s Chlorobite.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; a distant scream echoed. The two mysterious figures quickly dispersed into the jungle, leaving Blute and the gang. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Quick! They might keep trying to burn the jungle down to find the Uggmite slug!&rdquo; Blute announced, strafing away and attempting to split up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is gonna get us killed! Ugh!&rdquo; Leia complained, following Lance towards the left. Again, they were in the jungle, navigating the intricate labyrinth it provided. Each tree set two new directions, forcing them to make tough decisions to find the masked villains.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The green surroundings slowly changed hue into a more yellow tone as the group and the masked villains finally crawled through the jungle, entering the vast desert.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait up&hellip;&rdquo; a voice growled. Lance immediately recognized that voice to be Kahlos&#39;s, his mech roaring and quickly accelerating to catch up to the gang. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">One of the villains swirled right, Worlem following him back into the jungle. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo; Blute yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He can manage himself!&rdquo; Lance exclaimed, motioning for the cave trolls to come closer. Meanwhile, Worlem found himself beside the villain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It cannot be!&rdquo; Worlem stuttered, noticing that it was a molenoid all along.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Miss me, Worlem?&rdquo; the molenoid smirked, loading a Sirenzar into his blaster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ned! My life, long, nemesis!&rdquo; Worlem grumbled, his teeth gritting in anger. &ldquo;Ahhhh!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Worlem threw his fist up, firing a pre-loaded Flopper slug from his blaster at Ned&#39;s blaster. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! As if a Flopper will do anything!&rdquo; Ned laughed. However, Worlem&#39;s Flopper perfectly slid into the barrel of Ned&#39;s blaster, jamming it completely. &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The Sirenzar slug suddenly became enraged, its flames exploding and knocking both Ned and Worlem off their mechs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You devious scum!&rdquo; Ned croaked as he got up from the explosion. Worlem was still unconscious, on the ground. Ned was baffled, but couldn&#39;t do much with his blaster now being totalled. &ldquo;Absolute Flopper-brain,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ned hastily left Worlem behind and rushed back to headquarters. He knew he couldn&rsquo;t find the djinn as he had already sniffed around, that the djinn was long gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">On the other hand, Lance and the rest were right behind the other villain, finally being able to see a glimpse of his face. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, if it isn&#39;t the urban legend Lance Freeman!&rdquo; the man grinned, waving casually towards Lance. Pulling his blaster out, the man equipped a Spazzer slug. Aiming towards the sky, the man didn&#39;t hesitate to pull the trigger. &ldquo;Remember my name, Quizzy!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A cloud of maroon smoke emerged, slowly diffusing upon the group. &ldquo;Run! It&#39;s a ghouled Gazzer! The gas paralyses you!&rdquo; Daphne exclaimed, trying to outrun the smoke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Quizzy stopped and turned around, watching the group struggle from the gas. &ldquo;Oopsie!&rdquo; Quizzy laughed, firing a Tempesto, displacing the gas even faster. The group inevitably inhaled the poisoned cloud of smoke, all of them falling off their mechs and their blasters falling from their grip. Quizzy slowly walked over as the gas finally faded, looming over them as if they were flies he had swatted. They laid motionless on the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I wonder what the Emperor will do with this odd bunch&hellip;&rdquo; Quizzy snickered. He cracked his knuckles, his expression growing more sinister.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We will never bow to the Emperor!&rdquo; Kahlos yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Screw you!&rdquo; Blute added, his voice in pain. Quizzy kicked Lance hard in the stomach, then leant down beside him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You tell us where that Thyst is, and I&#39;ll let you get a large sum&hellip;&rdquo; Quizzy whispered. Lance struggled, trying to squirm free from Quizzy&#39;s grasp. &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kahlos groaned. Slowly rubbing away the paralysis, Kahlos slowly reached for his blaster that laid a short distance away. Inch by inch, Kahlos sneakily eyed Quizzy down, monitoring his moves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How do you know&hellip;she&#39;s here?&rdquo; Lance asked, gritting his teeth together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let&#39;s just say&hellip;An acquaintance of mine told me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The Goone Twins?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course! Clive and Clove are my best minions&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kahlos finally reached his blaster, his grip tightening. From his capsules, a White Boon Doc weakly hopped out, crawling into the blaster. As Kahlos pulled the trigger, the slug velocimorphed, mending the paralysis from everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s this? The paralysis is already gone?&rdquo; Quizzy froze. He directed his attention to Kahlos, with the White Boon Doc hopping into his palm. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lance quickly pounced on Quizzy, tackling him to the ground with a loud thud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oof!&rdquo; Quizzy squealed. He was quickly pinned down by Lance with the assistance of Blute and Kahlos. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;There is no way that this just happened!&rdquo; Quizzy flailed his arms and legs around, attempting to escape from the Cave Trolls&rsquo; grip. It was no use. &ldquo;I don&#39;t believe it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;We must leave at once!&rdquo; a voice emerged, a flash of light beaming by. Kahlos and Blute were left like deers in headlights, stunned by a flashing bullet pulling Quizzy away. Just what was that? It didn&#39;t feel real, there was no slug that could move that fast that could hold such weight. Exactly just what was that? </span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.pkfob81csdiv"><span class="c3">Chapter 10</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ashley, floppin&rsquo; Thyst,&rdquo; grumbled Maxor. Though defeating Kilbert, he still felt unsatisfied, unable to settle his inner chaos. His teeth grated against one another, and his breath quickened. &ldquo;Die&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Maxor was enraged, perhaps in a state of madness and it felt like nothing could hold him back from pursuing Ash&#39;s trail. He stood alone in his study, staring outside the window that overlooked the Great Dividing String. It was still slightly dark, a grunt echoing from the hallways of the castle.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Maxor barked, disturbed by the fact someone was up. It didn&rsquo;t surprise him that it was Midnyte and Mordecai, but at a time like this, it was quite unpleasant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m going on a mission,&rdquo; Maxor muttered, leaving Midnyte and Mordecai behind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? At this time of day?&rdquo; Midnyte questioned sleepily. The solaryte crystals had begun to illuminate, their beaming rays slowly surfacing the golden sand. Like the sun, the crystals had little heat radiating from it, allowing a cool breeze to drift through the window of Maxor&#39;s study. Midnyte yawned as he gazed at the pink skyline. &ldquo;It&#39;s 6 in the morning&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Whatever. I&#39;ll get this job done&hellip;&rdquo; Maxor grunted, pushing his way outside. He quietly jumped on his mech and rode off.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, Ash was asleep, sheltering beside her mech for maximal comfort. The greenery slowly lit up and a subtle reflection formed on the small lake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Aaaah&hellip;&quot; Ash stretched, rising from her slumber. The air was warm, coated with a thick scent of exotic flowers and morning dew. She was still half asleep, her body still adjusting to the warmth from the Solaryte crystals. She slowly got up and jumped on her mech, riding around to find something to eat. She was starving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As she weakly rode past the oasis back into the desert, Ash felt sick, her stomach gurgling loudly. She needed to find a town or something. It didn&#39;t look good, but she had to keep moving forward. Finally, about a kilometer or so Ash saw greenery. The sand had suddenly stopped at the green of the jungle that sat beside it. The juxtaposition of these two environments was striking, like nature had drawn a line in the sand. Ash didn&#39;t hesitate and accelerated deep into the jungle, trying to find fruits or anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As she weaved through the low-hanging vines, Ash discovered the core of the jungle. It wasn&#39;t any ordinary place, it was inhabited. Inhabited by something or someone. The technology seemed advanced, with holograms and drones whizzing around the cramped airspace. The houses and buildings appeared rooted or even embedded into the towering trees and it felt ethereal. It was like the desert and this place were two different worlds. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Vinnie, stay hidden, I&#39;ll try to find some food&hellip;&quot; Ash whispered, slowly walking towards the buildings. The paved roads glowed with a faint bioluminescence, casting a faint but ethereal teal light. An overhanging neon sign flickered, the text reading Fish&#39;d. A cave troll walked through, spotting Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Hey! Who are you?&quot; the startled cave troll yelled, surprising Ash. With a defensive nature, the cave troll gripped a nearby pan and threatened Ash, giving her a cold stare. Her eyes narrowed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Um, sorry, do you have any food?&quot; Ash begged. Her stomach again gurgled and she looked at the cave troll&#39;s eyes in desperate hope. It was clear that she was honest, and the cave troll saw that, but the question on the credibility of Ash was floating in the cave troll&rsquo;s mind.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The cave troll rolled her eyes. &quot;Are you related, affiliated or have ever been part of the Emperor&#39;s forces?&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;No.&quot; Ash said firmly. She crossed her fingers and hoped for the cave troll to approve of her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Alright&hellip;That&#39;ll be 5 gold though. You ain&#39;t eating free,&quot; the cave troll coughed, () the pan. The cave troll disappeared again, back into the kitchen. There was a pungent aroma that soon slowly crept out the crevice of the door that led to the kitchen, a strong, fried scent that reminded Ash of home. Her real home. It wasn&rsquo;t long until the cave troll walked out again with a steaming hot plate of deep fried fish and some potato chips, garnished with a special sauce on the side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It felt like home for Ash as she had never expected cave trolls to enjoy the same food as those on the surface. Fish and chips she thought. A classical dish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow, this looks good!&rdquo; Ash remarked, taking a big bite from the fish fillet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The cave troll chuckled embarrassingly. &ldquo;Real outsider eh? Not many come past this place&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I guess you can say that,&rdquo; Ash replied, chewing happily on the crispy chips. &ldquo;Say, is this popular?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;The fish and chips?&quot; the cave troll grunted. &quot;Well, if I have to say, it&#39;s a treat to have. Fish are quite rare and require Aquabeaks to help catch. And finding an Aquabeak is hard!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash devoured her meal as she curiously listened in to the cave troll explaining the rich culture they had made in the jungle, a safe haven away from the opposing forces. Ash didn&#39;t hesitate to compliment the city&#39;s advanced technology and innovative design, and also generously tipped the cave troll. As she finished her meal, she hastily left, back on her way. She was still mesmerized by the city and stayed to wander a bit more around, checking out the cool buildings. Though wonderstruck, she knew she had to leave as she didn&#39;t want to get caught by another cave troll. She found them extremely scary to face.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nevertheless, as Ash kept to her stoic nature and left the city, knowing that she was never safe. Just what exactly was that Kilbert guy saying? His voice still rang in her mind, his words sinking into her chest. Her body wandered freely, controlling her pace through the thick canopy of trees. As she ventured further from the city&#39;s boundaries, her thoughts drifted between Kilbert&#39;s mysterious words and the sanctuary she was leaving behind. The jungle&#39;s protective embrace had offered her a glimpse of peace, however brief it might have been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, the vibrant green melted into a dull yellow palette that coloured the desert scorching hot. It was like facing reality once again, her mind slowly burning at the thought of travelling through the desert. The jungle had allowed her to fall away from this false reality she was forced to be a part of.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Unlike the rest of the desert, there was a stretch of train tracks that sat in the sand. It looked rusted and old, the train being out of service. Though, that didn&#39;t stop Ash from hearing a faint, distant screech that slowly grew louder. Something was speeding down the tracks. Maxor. He was back on his mech, accelerating faster and faster. The clinking and clanking on the rails ricocheted through Ash&#39;s mind, her heartbeat growing intensely. She was being hunted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sand whipped around her mech as she pushed it to its limits, the ancient tracks groaning beneath its weight. The desert sun beat down mercilessly, and sweat trickled down her neck as she searched desperately for any means of escape. But the endless dunes offered no refuge, no place to hide from her relentless pursuer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">In the distance, fuzzy figures stood tall. Her vision was weakening through the immense heat. Maxor was unfazed, his endurance stronger than hers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Give up now, Thyst!&quot; Maxor laughed. &quot;You cannot outrun me!&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash kept strong. The figures slowly became in focus as Ash rode towards them. It seemed like a mirage as the figures kept flickering in her sight. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Ash&hellip;&quot; a voice whispered through the sand. Ash couldn&#39;t picture who the mysterious figure was, but she was headed straight for the silhouette outlined by the tanned air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Who&hellip;are you?&quot; Ash&#39;s voice trembled. Suddenly, it felt like the air tugged on her violently, yanking her back. Maxor was behind her and his mech&#39;s mechanical tusk hooked her mech. It was over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ash tumbled onto the ground forcefully. A hand reached down to her. She gently clasped her palm, locking hands with the mysterious figure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you for ages&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The fog of sand grew denser, Maxor struggling to aim his blaster. His Negablade and Spasm slug was already loaded, ready for the deathly fusion shot. He was just uncertain where they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come out&hellip;Come to me&hellip;&rdquo; Maxor growled, tensing his grip. His mech waddled forward, dispersing the fog slightly to expose Ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash&hellip;&rdquo; the figure whispered. Again, Ash was still confused by the sand covered silhouette, her expression growing in worry. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Ash exclaimed, her heartbeat jumping high. A blaster aimed, and a trigger was pulled. The sound rang and frightened the two, forcing the figure to make a move. He quickly pulled Ash aside, but Maxor was two steps ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! You fell for the oldest trick in the book&hellip;I have two blasters!&rdquo; Maxor snickered as he threw his second blaster out. It was a fake warning shot and they fell for it. Maxor pulled the trigger, the fusion forming and exploded on impact. An enormous void-like portal violently ripped through space, sending the two into a different dimension. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">~</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ash, you awake?&rdquo; the figure asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;Who&hellip;is&hellip;&rdquo; Ash mumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Lance. I know you probably don&rsquo;t want to see me again, but I really need your help. Please,&rdquo; Lance begged. His voice softened, leaning down and helping Ash up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Ash asked, surveying the environment. It was pitch black like a void, with nothing. Lance equipped a Firenzar, helping to light the way. Finally, it was bright and the void turned into a stale old warehouse that was engulfed in darkness. Metallic beams loomed overhead and cargo boxes stood beside them. As they explored the confined space, they found bodies. Dead bodies. Just what was this implied void they had come to? Ash felt like it was so familiar, yet so different. Exactly what was that fusion? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It didn&rsquo;t take long for Ash and Lance to find the doors of the warehouse. They slowly opened the door. The sun immediately obliterated their sight upon view, blinding them in ungodly ways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; Lance exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the sun, dumbass! It&#39;s&hellip;wait. </span><span class="c7">It is</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the sun?&rdquo; Ash questioned. She couldn&rsquo;t believe what she was seeing. They weren&rsquo;t in Slugterra. This was, indeed, the Burning World. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
