The helicopter hovered steadily above the Indonesian soil, allowing for Director Ozim to get a better view of the issue. There appeared to be another cosmic anomaly that Director Ozim wanted to inspect with Elias.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That is what is known as the Indonesian Eyes,&rdquo; Ozim explained. &ldquo;Nobody knows where it came from and what its purpose is,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ozim ordered the pilot to descend, with the two men landing safely on the ground. As they reached closer to the statue that was placed in the center of public view, a strange, distant energy signal emitted from the eyes of the statue. It wasn&rsquo;t normal. Although it depicted that of a monk of some sort with the bald head and rustic robes it wore, it felt eerily out of place, not belonging to the correct culture and history.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After all, Elias did graduate with a masters in Anthropology. He understood human nature and this was nothing like what he had experienced before. Suddenly, a ghostly presence summoned within the statue, emitting like a hologram as it spewed itself from the mouth of the statue.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Greetings cosmic entity&hellip;I see you possess the power of the Jespans&hellip;Your presence has revived me, marking my mission to begin!&rdquo; the hologram laughed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Director Ozim jumped backwards, alerted by the sudden emergence of this entity. &ldquo;Who are you? What is this mission that you require to begin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The hologram took the form of the exact monk the statue had depicted, its translucent nature becoming more opaque as it descended onto the ground. &ldquo;My name is Magha, a servant of the great Jespan Lords. I will not disclose my mission, so I will be gone!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Magha extended his ghostly arms into Elias&rsquo;s body, ripping his powers away from him. Elias tried to pull away and attack Magha, but due to his ghostly form, all his attacks passed him and didn&rsquo;t register. He was somehow undead, stripping his powers away. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Magha snickered. As Elias&rsquo;s power drained, Magha violently tore his arms back out of Elias&rsquo;s body, leaving him drowsy, with minimum power. Elias&rsquo;s vision blurred, stumbling as he took a step back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Elias!&rdquo; Director Ozim yelled, helping him walk. Quickly, the two rushed to the helicopter ready to escape.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Leaving so soon?&rdquo; Magha questioned, grinning mischievously. As the helicopter rose back into the air, the nearby huts collapsed instantly as a humongous skeleton arose from the ground, tearing the Earth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My lord! An undead necromancer!&rdquo; Director Ozim exclaimed, terrified at the sight. Suddenly, the skeleton began to collapse in on itself, creating a large explosion that flung out his bones. Instead of flying randomly, the bones aimed towards Elias, knocking him out of Ozim&rsquo;s grasp and sending him flying out into the sky, in a completely different direction. &ldquo;Elias!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ozim&rsquo;s words rang in Elias&rsquo;s ear as he felt the wind rush against his body. He was weak, unable to do anything. He flew through the air, carried by the bones to a distant place. Where? He didn&rsquo;t know. All he knew was that he felt the cool night breeze brush past him, hinting at the possibility of traveling through the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The morning sun cast ethereal glows among the small tribal village that resided within East Timor. It was warm, the sunlight had bathed the soft green grass of the rolling hills that carried a dense barrier of natural forest. It was far from where Elias had first come from, that being suburban areas of Indonesia. Elias rubbed his eyes, waking from his painful slumber.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He couldn&rsquo;t feel the cosmic energy anymore. He couldn&rsquo;t feel his power flowing through his body anymore. There was no feeling, there was no power. It felt different. No, it wasn&rsquo;t anything supernatural, but he felt human again. Just numbing pain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The soft glow around his vision subtly blurred, enlarging the dense view of the landscape. Slowly, light seeped in, revealing the enchanting environment. It was strange for Elias to have woken up in a strange place, and he had no clue on where he was and how long he was knocked out for. Wherever he was, he needed to return back to base. The International Supernatural Intelligence Division needed him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He sat up weakly, pushing against the soft grass. He was alone but not afraid. A soft, small shape pressed against his body and Elias glanced around. There were four, radiant creatures that emitted a cosmic glow, casting their innocent expressions up towards Elias&rsquo;s grim frown. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&hellip;what are you?&rdquo; Elias muttered. &ldquo;You feel like my power&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creatures nodded. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re&hellip;my power? Fragments of it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creatures nodded again, in sync. They were companions to say the least, perhaps even as unbreakable pieces of Elias&rsquo;s own body. It felt surreal, but the existence of these creatures was enigmatic and relieving. Was there still hope for Elias to regain his powers? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The creatures began to ecstatically jump around, enthusiastic to perform. What was their true nature? Elias still couldn&rsquo;t figure out what exactly they were. The uneasy tension was still unbroken between them, with Elias being somewhat skeptical to accept them for who they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Instead, the creatures jumped carelessly onto Elias&rsquo;s body as if they were his pets, hopping up and down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What can you do if you&rsquo;re my power?&rdquo; Elias asked. The creatures stared at Elias for a moment, then motioned for him to throw them into the air. &ldquo;Me? Throw you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias hesitated for a moment, then reluctantly threw the blue creature into the sky. As it sped through the air, the creature&rsquo;s body transformed into a majestical shape, depicting that of a serpent or dragon. It sliced through the air, spewing out a gelatinous liquid. Its body was quite strange, for it seemed to be made of pure liquid, water perhaps. Elias was astonished, he couldn&rsquo;t believe such strange creatures had possessed such unique powers. The ability to transform into magical beasts? Insane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Moreover, it seemed that the four creatures had represented the four elements of water, fire, earth and air. If Elias knew anything, it was that these creatures were going to be having a crazy journey. He decided at that moment, something had happened. An urgent matter required his attention.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I need to get home! Or, we need to take Magha down!&rdquo; Elias explained, now gathering the creatures together. &ldquo;While I still have you all, let&rsquo;s get home safely and beat everything that tries to get in our way!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias sprinted towards the village that was located near where he woke up. Instead of finding an intact, stable town, the village was engulfed in flames, destruction was everywhere. Locals were screaming, and something must have happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Magha!&rdquo; Elias muttered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Elias asked the locals, aiding them by putting out the fires with his water creature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;No! Some </span><span>egghead</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;destroyed our village!&rdquo; locals complained, describing the appearance of the terroriser. Elias concluded from the depictions the locals had outlined to be Magha and no one else. Only he had the ability to summon the souls of skeletons as he recognised scrawny bones appearing from the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Of course&hellip;It&#39;s </span><span class="c5">him</span><span class="c2">&hellip;&rdquo; Elias grumbled. It didn&#39;t surprise Elias, as Magha was the one who stripped him of his power. Angry, Elias began taking down the skeletons with his newly equipped creatures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Taste my creatures!&rdquo; Elias yelled, slinging his arsenal of creatures towards the skeletons. Quickly, they broke apart and a pile of bones remained on the ground. With his fire creature, Elias burnt them all to ash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is everyone alright?&rdquo; Elias asked, checking up around the village. Using his creatures, he helped rescue any stuck residents, helping everyone safely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you boy&hellip;those creatures of yours look rather similar to etchings from a nearby temple&hellip;&rdquo; a local suggested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, go through the forest and it should be on the other side,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you so much!&rdquo; Elias smiled, bolting off. Similar etchings in a temple? Was this another Jespan structure on Earth? He couldn&#39;t believe it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As he darted through the trees like a maze, skeletons rose from the solid ground. Again. Each tree Elias weaved through he managed to throw a creature, directed towards each skeleton that rose to challenge him. It wasn&#39;t a challenge, but keeping his momentum throughout was difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A clearing centered in his vision suddenly, for an open glad to have appeared in front of him was quite a miracle. Was this the temple? Suddenly, two skeletons grasped his shoulders, pulling him down. As a last ditch effort, Elias threw his air creature into the sky, but it didn&#39;t hit anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stupid skeletons, get off me!&rdquo; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As he waved his arms and hands around, he saw the air creature change directions in the air, realising he had full control over them all this time. Freely controlling the creatures changed his perspective as he raised his arms, allowing for the air creature to sweep the two skeletons in the face, knocking them out in one action.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, rushing forward. Indeed, there was a temple tucked away in the glade, a moss-ridden pyramid-shaped temple stood solitude in the woods. It was ominous to say the least, and Elias quietly snuck in. If anyone was to be here, it would be Magha. What was he after?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, well, well. Look who&#39;s back for more!&rdquo; Magha roared, jumping Elias as he stepped out from the shadows the entrance had captured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Elias jumped back, trying to push Magha back. He forgot for a moment, he was a ghost and fell to the ground backwards instinctively, rolling away from his dangerous hologram.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Die!&rdquo; Elias yelled. He began slinging the cosmic creatures at Magha, weaving them through the skeletons he had started summoned. The skeletons were fragile now that Elias understood his power. The skeletons fell one by one, with multiple of the creatures landing a direct hit on Magha. Magha endured the hits, attempting to tank the damage. He didn&#39;t flinch nor panic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is that all you can do? Magha mocked. He summoned a skeleton right before Elias, knocking him back. Elias was sent flying backwards violently into the wall, crashing with impact. &ldquo;Hahaha!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Magha sneered, laughing like a child. As he laughed, the final cosmic creature hit him. He flicked it off, thinking nothing of it. &ldquo;The ritual is over! My mission is complete! Now to eliminate you&hellip;&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You had already lost the moment the cosmic creatures touched you&hellip;&rdquo; Elias smirked through his gritted teeth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; Magha looked confused. Then, his stomach began to grow. His size slowly increased, his stomach bloated, followed by his body turning into something of a balloon. &ldquo;What? Impossible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Magha&#39;s fingers had left the statues, interrupting the ritual. He rolled around the room like a ball, growing larger by the second. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are overflowing with cosmic energy&hellip;even if you are dead, spirits carry cosmic energy&hellip;But they have special properties&hellip;&rdquo; Elias explained, wiping the blood off his face. His powers seeped back into his body, a nostalgic feeling entering his blood. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This can&#39;t be&hellip;My energy levels&hellip;They&#39;re going beyond! Us spirits can only take so much! I&#39;m gonna implode! I&#39;m gonna&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Magha was cut off by a blinding white light, a burst of cosmic energy engulfing the room. His spirit faded, his presence gone. Magha was dead, now officially redirected out of the world. No longer a ghost, no longer a spirit. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A surge of cosmic energy reignited within Elias&#39;s body, granting his powers back. His creatures? They had disappeared. They were indeed fragments of his power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, voices rang from the entrance, footsteps growing louder and louder.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fool! What took you so long?&rdquo; a voice yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Director Ozim!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, happy to see him. He was hoping for a hug or congratulations, but he was met with a stern look.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Magha has revived the Lords! You were too slow!&rdquo; Ozim yelled, his voice laced with worry and panic. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Elias replied, eyes widening. He felt a sickening sensation within his body. There were more cosmic deities, stronger than Magha? It felt impossible. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We don&#39;t know where they are. These Jespan Lords&hellip;&rdquo; Ozim began. He was furious, but also relieved that Elias was alive. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Director, I had my powers taken&hellip;I didn&#39;t know how much faster I could&#39;ve beat him,&rdquo; Elias apologised, his tone quietening down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s alright,&rdquo; Ozim explained. Whatever stood in front of them was a new challenge. At least Magha was resolved, for nobody had to worry about his necromantic presence haunting anyone ever again. Nobody would ever see the dead again, and nobody would be stripped of their powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ozim quietly congratulated Elias, giving him a much needed hug and a formal pat on the back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It&#39;s alright kid, we&#39;ll get them next time.&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.bcswqf7gnbv4"><span class="c3">II - The Water Runs Deep in the East</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rain fell like glass beads on the window still. Drip, drop. It was another rainy night. The streets hummed a quiet trail of traffic, with cars speeding past the highway that positioned itself outside the small apartment window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was another rainy night, where Wei could not sleep. He learnt against the window, watching the raindrops fall from the glass. Drip, drop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was quiet and Wei could think clearly, something he could not do for a long time. For once, his mind was clear in the darkness of the night. A voice whispered low in his ear, his mind drifting away into the dark.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The shadows&hellip;&rdquo; the voice hissed faintly. Wei looked around, spaced out from all his movements. His body slowly sank into the darkness, landing softly in a black abyss. It felt cool, a much crispier fragrance, a change into fresh air perhaps. It was a completely different world and Wei felt calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He let everything go and laid there in the darkness, letting the shadows engulf his body. There he finally slept, quietly as the darkness finally glowed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The morning light, like a tide, lifted Wei adrift, pulling him into the warm sunlight that beamed through the window. His eyes fluttered, waking up. He got ready for another tedious day of school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The class had an excursion to the Dujiangyan today, to learn about its history. Again, Wei was uninterested. As they peered over the observation deck, small waves crashed ashore the fish&#39;s mouth, the island that split the Minjiang river in half.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">However, one current didn&#39;t follow the rest and a ripple formed upon the water&#39;s surface. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wei, why don&#39;t you come over? Take a look at the river!&rdquo; their teacher chirped. Wei didn&#39;t care, he shrugged and remained in the shadow, leaning against the stone wall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; a voice chuckled faintly. It came from the river, and the man was soaked in water. He was naked, drawing the attention of nearby visitors. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, what the hell are you doing? You are trespassing on sacred land!&rdquo; a guard yelled. He placed his uncapped cup of steaming hot coffee aside, ready to approach the man. The man&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, the man&rsquo;s left arm disappeared, detaching itself from his body leaving no blood. The arm reappeared from the cup of coffee, knocking out the guard instantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve waited so long for this moment! Ahahaha!&rdquo; the man laughed. Wei was drawn to the man&rsquo;s presence, a mystical aura. Was he human? His arm returned to him, attaching back on like nothing had happened. Wei stepped closer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wei! Stay back!&rdquo; their teacher commanded, using her arm to motion to the students. The man began to splash the water violently, with droplets flying high and forming into small clumps. The water descended like rain, gushing down like glass shards. The man crouched, releasing small rocks into the water. The rocks followed the fast descent and began to shower the class, hitting and bruising the teacher and students.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Kids! Remain calm! Wait&hellip;where&rsquo;s Wei?&rdquo; the teacher panicked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Miss, I&rsquo;m right here!&rdquo; Wei yelled, terrified. But no one could hear him. He saw the darkness capturing him again, just like last night where he was pulled into the warm embrace of the shadows. Was this a curse? The water had formed a puddle outside the shadow Wei had stood, standing menacingly. Then, the man appeared. He rose from the puddle and struck his teacher.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the child?&rdquo; the man demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who? Which child? Who are you?&rdquo; the teacher begged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Me? I am Kartika. Where is the Scorpion?&rdquo; Kartika yelled. The teacher remained silent. She gasped for breath as Kartika&rsquo;s grip on her neck tightened. &ldquo;Speak you miserable human!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nooo!&rdquo; Wei cried. His faint scream from the shadows seeped out, catching the attention of Kartika. Throwing the teacher aside onto the ground, Kartika bent down and inspected the eerie shadow. Wei realised, trying to remain silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh? You&rsquo;re </span><span class="c5">in</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;the shadows? What an interesting power of the scorpion&hellip;But it won&rsquo;t change the fact that I, Kartika will end you! Bahahahaha!&rdquo; Kartika laughed. Kartika began thrashing the landmark, destroying the walls trying to remove all shadows. Wei ran into Kartika&rsquo;s shadow, trying to hit him. As he surfaced, he kicked Kartika, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahahaha! You think a puny kick of yours is enough to defeat me, Kartika?&rdquo; Kartika exclaimed, taunting Wei. It was clear that this was an unfair battle. An experienced, thousand year old underlord versus a young, inexperienced teenager with no idea of their own powers. Wei struggled as Kartika held him and threw him around. Luckily for Wei, he landed in the shadows where he ran and ran, away from the fight like a coward. He couldn&rsquo;t do anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Breaking news: Historical Chinese Landmark Dujiangyan Irrigation System has been destroyed by an unknown person.&rdquo; the TV broadcasted. The cozy living room inside the modern suburban home in Wales stood alone on the block. It was an average afternoon, where Rayne was bored. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Although it was a weekend, Rayne didn&#39;t like socialising that much. He didn&#39;t have many friends, yet any plans to even do so. All he could think of was to stay home and enjoy life, something reasonable for a 14-year-old. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He trembled as he heard the lines being spoken, a terrible shiver crawling down his spine. A school excursion turned into an attack? And a naked god-like being able to create rifts of water? He had to do something. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rayne! You forgot to do the dishes from lunch!&rdquo; his mother&rsquo;s voice boomed from the kitchen. Rayne&rsquo;s late realisation struck him like a nail, almost forgetting to do the chores. He trudged to the kitchen where he began to scrub the dishes. As he scrubbed, he felt a plate nearing the edge of the sink pressing into his body. As he slowly moved out the way, the plate tumbled down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Noo!&rdquo; Rayne cried. His eyes darted around before looking at the shattered plate, hoping his mother was not around. Surprisingly, when he looked down, the plate didn&rsquo;t break, instead it was floating inside a bubble. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Rayne thought. He grabbed it, and the bubble disappeared. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rayne dear, what is wrong?&rdquo; his mother called out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing! Almost dropped a dish, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; Rayne smiled, looking innocent. He went back to doing the dishes, trying to ignore and forget what had happened. Was it divine intervention? Or something more supernatural perhaps? He was confused. Did he secretly gain superpowers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The next day rolled around, and Rayne was in history class. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to notify that students who are taking French classes will be having a week-long excursion to France while the Chinese class students will be going to Chengdu!&rdquo; the teacher announced. What? Chengdu? Rayne was taking the Chinese classes his school offered, and going to Chengdu felt strange. There was an incident just yesterday, and their class is continuing on with the trip?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um, sir? Did you see the news?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh yeah, the water irrigation accident? It&rsquo;s fine, we weren&rsquo;t too fussed about it. We&rsquo;re there to explore the cuisine and pandas more importantly,&rdquo; the teacher replied. Rayne didn&rsquo;t believe it and was skeptical on the trip, but the teacher kept insisting to him that it was going to be fine. The days passed and Rayne packed for the trip. He was still nervous that everything would go wrong. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I feel two bodies&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika murmured. It was a peaceful morning and Rayne&#39;s class were walking down the streets of Chengdu. They had arrived the day earlier, taking it as a break and resting up. There had been a downpour during the night as there were many puddles on the main road, along with the excess water dripping off the old and dirty infrastructure that lined the road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Wei scoffed as he stepped out of the small apartment complex. He looked around, then something tugged on him. A magical force perhaps. Rayne felt it too, and he followed it like a dog on a leash, onto the road.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rayne! Watch out!&rdquo; his classmate yelled. A car sped down and Rayne panicked, hesitating. He flinched and closed his eyes, unable to watch anymore. But again, his bubbles saved him somehow. He didn&#39;t even issue the command, rather it was instant. It encapsulated the car perfectly, preventing it from hitting Rayne. His classmates watched in awe and his teacher was wonderstruck.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rayne! Get off the road, now!&rdquo; his teacher ordered. Rayne obliged as he saw more cars approaching. However, this didn&#39;t stop Kartika from attacking. Though Rayne barely was able to leave the road, Kartika plunged out of the puddle, knocking the car that drove over it. It flipped and crashed to the ground. Rayne knew he could save those innocent lives, but it all happened too fast. His reflexes weren&#39;t enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s it! You constellations are a problem! I will be disposing of both of you&hellip;right now!&rdquo; Kartika growled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Wei spat out his water at the sight of Kartika. &ldquo;That guy is the enemy! He tried to kill me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That half naked guy?&rdquo; Rayne yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&lsquo;Yes!&rdquo; Wei replied. His voice was filled with urgency as he stepped back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kartika lunged towards the sidewalk, demolishing anything that stood upon his path. As he crashed down, a bubble hovered beside him. His gaze shifted, then the bubble popped. It exploded, displacing Kartika slightly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;WHAT?&rdquo; Kartika exclaimed. Trying his best to not praise the boy, Kartika ruthlessly spat out blood from his mouth. &ldquo;So, you&#39;re the claw they call?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Please, I don&#39;t mean no harm, I don&#39;t want to fight you!&rdquo; Rayne pleaded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you kids not realise what responsibilities you have taken? Do you think this power granted to you is just a mere gift to improve your daily lives? These abilities are the manifestations of your weaknesses, and yet, you chose not to use them?&rdquo; Kartika began. Rayne was still confused. Wei threw a disappointed expression at Rayne as he watched.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The stars had to perfectly align for you&hellip;The sun, moon and ascendant&hellip;All housing the same star&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika remarked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Wei listened then reflected. Was it fate that gave him these powers? He tried connecting the dots. He was in fact a Scorpio, but what did it mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You two kids have no clue what you got yourselves into, am I right? You don&#39;t even know you&#39;ve become supernatural beings!&rdquo; Kartika snarled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Rayne nodded, leaving his class. His teacher couldn&#39;t care less and let Rayne follow Wei, a pair of supernatural disasters. Kartika wasn&#39;t waiting. With a maniacal laugh, he dissolved into a nearby puddle, disappearing from sight. The town was thrashed, thanks to Kartika.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;ISID reporting!&rdquo; a voice sparked. The boys turned their heads to see a young man, around his 20s on the street where the incident had happened. &ldquo;Kartika is headed to North Korea. We need to beat him. Is Elias back yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, he&#39;s powerless. Magha&#39;s the threat for now. We&#39;re unable to do anything&hellip;we must wait&hellip;&rdquo; the voice at the other end of the phone spoke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; the man replied, handing up. As he walked down, he noticed the two boys. &ldquo;Hey, everything is going to be fine kids! The International Supernatural Intelligence Division will control this,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A beep sounded from the man&#39;s belt. &ldquo;Hm? That&#39;s strange. My cosmic detector is ringing. There must be an issue,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The beep began beeping faster as he took it out. Darkness spewed out from Wei, radiating a menacing aura. Rayne pushed out bubbles, surrounding him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No way&hellip;Do you two have superpowers?&rdquo; the man asked. The two boys looked at each other and laughed. The man was confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So are you willing to help us save the world?&rdquo; the man asked hesitantly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s in it for us?&rdquo; Rayne asked impatiently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; the man smiled, opening his notepad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I can work with that,&rdquo; the man said. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, I haven&#39;t formally introduced myself. My name is Sylvester Stylar. Have you ever been on a private jet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The boys were soon aboard one of the ISID&#39;s many private jets. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ll need those forms completed soon. I will notify your family about it. Don&#39;t stress, we&#39;ve got it all under control,&rdquo; said Sylvester. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nothing disturbed Iseul&#39;s state of mind. Always adrift in a far away land, with dreams that barrelled with luscious and vibrant green sceneries. He took a deep breath. He didn&#39;t like his home. He always felt different, isolated in a country that confined itself from the rest of the world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Iseul thought it was as if he was stuck in an artificial world, unable to escape the chains of a fake life that puppeted the actions of those around him. Everything seemed robotic and monotone in Pyongyang. Dreams were Iseul&#39;s escape, but lately they had become something more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Last night&#39;s dream had been the most vivid yet. Two boys his age stood in the shadow and light, calling to him across an ocean. One controlled darkness like ink, the other created by droplets of air. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">That morning, as he walked to school a strange feeling disturbed his peaceful mind of his dreams. His dreams were becoming clearer by the minute. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Please identify yourself,&rdquo; the command tower broadcasted. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;ISID Force. International threat code 5, unknown entity is in your country,&rdquo; Sylvester replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Enter with caution,&rdquo; the command tower announced. The plane descended. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, so what we know about the enemy is that their ability is to create rifts in bodies of liquid. Be careful when around bodies of liquid,&rdquo; Sylvester commented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My power is so cool! I can shoot bubbles and stuff! What about you, Wei?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mine? I don&#39;t know much, but I can travel through shadows&hellip;&rdquo; Wei replied shyly. He still wasn&#39;t confident about his power as he didn&#39;t know how to use it well and only saw it as an ability to escape and hide.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We&#39;re almost here. Looking at your forms, you seem to have something called a Perfect Sign,&rdquo; Sylvester remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s a Perfect Sign?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, this might explain why you were chosen. A Perfect Sign when someone had their sun, moon and rising sign under the same sign. I&#39;m assuming you are Scorpio Wei, and for you Rayne, Cancer?&rdquo; Sylvester explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! I get it now!&rdquo; Rayne said happily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Another thing, you both are water signs. Shouldn&#39;t there be a third? Pisces?&rdquo; Sylvester asked. The boys shrugged, not knowing who it was. Perhaps fate would answer that question when they disembarked the plane.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Iseul watched the plane descend. Normally, he never saw any planes. And this felt different. Something compelling was coming and Iseul couldn&#39;t wait. Instead of going to school, he decided to travel down the path that led towards the police station.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey kid, shouldn&#39;t you be at school?&rdquo; a nearby officer shouted. Iseul ignored him like he always did, trancing around in his daydream. &ldquo;Hey, are you listening to me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The officer approached Iseul and placed a hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Why are you ignoring me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, he disappeared. No trace, no evidence, just gone. Iseul sighed. That was what started to happen to anyone that got too close to him recently. Gone. And he didn&#39;t understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He didn&#39;t turn back nor look back, for something that loomed over him, like a guardian that protected its master. It slithered quietly and faded, a fragment of the cosmos perhaps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice serpent!&rdquo; a voice hissed. Iseul gazed at the figure that spoke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who&hellip;?&rdquo; Iseul whispered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Me&hellip;&rdquo; the voice whispered back, his cold breath reaching Iseul&#39;s neck. Where did the man come from? How did he suddenly teleport to him? &ldquo;My name is Kartika&hellip;I see you own that mythical serpent&hellip;It&#39;d be a shame if it were dead&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The saliva of the serpent formed a puddle on its tongue and Kartika was able to deliver a punch, knocking the serpent over. Iseul&#39;s eyes widened in shock. The serpent squirmed, phasing into the ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; The serpent rushed out of the pavement again, easily striking Kartika. He flew into the sky like a pebble, causing Wei to spot him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed. &ldquo;There&#39;s our guy!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sylvester called for agents while Wei and Rayne rushed to the site. Shadows took fast pursuit upon the trailing gutter that winded down the street. The serpent loomed over, crashing into the sidewalk and hopping to its target. Amidst the chaos, Wei stood strong, running in the shadows after Kartika. He noticed the serpents, but didn&#39;t see who or what was controlling them. Was it the Pisces constellation user?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Kartika surfaced, the serpents locked onto him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hahaha! You think you can beat me? Even if it&#39;s a 3 versus 1, I will still win! You are all mere children! Children!&rdquo; Kartika mocked as he splashed water towards the serpent. The serpent began its descent, attempting to crash down onto Kartika. &ldquo;You think you can hit me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Kartika was ready to dive, but he realised a fatal error. Where was Wei? He was gone. The serpent had cast a humongous shadow around him. His body froze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Trying to go somewhere?&rdquo; Wei whispered. His words slithered down Kartika&#39;s spine, his body unable to move. As Wei reentered the shadows, he pulled Kartika down, paralysing him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? This cannot be&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika bellowed. The serpent crashed into Kartika, crushing his body under the sheer pressure of the serpent&#39;s massive body and the dense concrete pavement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; Iseul asked. The serpent lifted its head and a puddle of blood sat there. Kartika was gone. He had used his blood as a rift. Iseul panicked, his sweat dripping down on his back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Heh, to think 3 children could beat an adult&hellip;You must be out of your mind!&rdquo; Kartika laughed, striking Iseul in the back. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Iseul spat weakly. He was tossed violently away, hitting the ground hard. &ldquo;You&hellip;You&hellip;appeared on my back?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Any form of liquid! Don&#39;t underestimate the mighty Kartika! Hahahaha!&rdquo; Kartika snickered. He leapt off the serpent, onto the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just realised something&hellip;&rdquo; Wei&#39;s voice echoed. Kartika froze. He looked around, no shadows in sight except his. The sun had dragged his shadow out long and thin and a pair of deep blue eyes flickered in the midst of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip;You can&#39;t&hellip;&rdquo; Kartika&#39;s voice shivered, his body tightening. He didn&#39;t know what was happening, but as he gazed at his shadow, he saw his hips being squeezed tight. It seemed to almost break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; A chain of bubbles sliced through the air, each exploding as they collided with Kartika&#39;s body. He wailed out in pain as Wei finally tore his shadow, tearing his body in half. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! Without my legs, I still live!&rdquo; Kartika growled, crawling to the nearest body of water. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You aren&#39;t going to go anywhere!&rdquo; Rayne shouted, trapping Kartika. His bubble nicely encased Kartika, floating him into the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? No no no, what are you going to do?&rdquo; Kartika begged. He pounded at the walls of the bubble, but it didn&#39;t do much. Rayne snapped his fingers. The bubble exploded, disintegrating Kartika&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s him sorted. So, are there 9 more kids like us? One for each Zodiac?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; Wei replied. Iseul shrugged. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you the Pisces constellation user?&rdquo; Rayne asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Me? Constellation?&rdquo; Iseul questioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s your name?&rdquo; Wei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Iseul. Iseul Baem&hellip;&rdquo; Iseul stuttered. He was nervous, but also surprised at the teamwork they had just achieved to take down Kartika. He had never felt anything like it before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He used to always rely on himself, but now he could accept others to help him. He always saw those around him as weaker than him, but now he saw something different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You wanna join us, the water trio?&rdquo; Rayne offered. &ldquo;We&#39;ll explain everything later as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Iseul replied. Sylvester reached the site only to find Kartika&#39;s legs intact with 3 other agents. They shrugged it off and congratulated the kids who aided them in the defeat of Kartika. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once isolated and hated, now united and dreaming. Dreamers for life would always find the most creative solutions, to destroy even those of the strongest power. That was what they believed in. That was what the water constellations had as power.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.rpcvl1ejvfbh"><span class="c3">III - Your Name Hurts like the Wind</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe was the queen of the sky. Though short-lived, due to her imprisonment in a coffin, specifically designed to keep air and liquid out, Paushe had been imprisoned for thousands of years. Her reign was terrifying, her ability to create air currents into people&rsquo;s throats and splatter their guts out was maniacal. It wasn&rsquo;t until a gentle afternoon at the port of Naples where a local fishing boat had discovered a hidden underwater ruin, encased by stone. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The new equipment they had gotten just the day earlier had already led to a discovery they never knew before. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have you been down there?&rdquo; a local asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We plan on getting some professional divers to look at it, who knows what we&#39;ll find?&rdquo; the fisherman replied. After a few days of negotiating and planning, the divers approached the ruins, breaking the stone walls. Suddenly, a strong current swept up the debris they had made, hurling them into the oxygen tanks. The divers panicked. They began to drown as the current tugged onto their legs tightly, as if it was like seaweed locking them in place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was so bizarre. How could a current be so powerful? The divers met their end, dying before they could even send a signal. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The early morning trees rustled in the quiet island of Yakushima. A quiet breeze entered the cozy villa the Sagashi family had resided in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ms J&#39;Ning, this is our daughter. I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re able to take care of her for the next month,&rdquo; Kasumi replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; a voice chirped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s Yurei&hellip;She&#39;s 14 and a very kind girl&hellip;&rdquo; Sora explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I see&hellip;Well, Yurei will be in good hands,&rdquo; Ms J&#39;Ning assured.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Very well. Yurei, me and papa must go for a work trip to Australia&hellip;We&#39;ll be back in a month,&rdquo; Kasumi hastily left as her husband, Riku, was already in the taxi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s your name?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mine? My name is Stella, and I prefer you to call me that. Calling me Ms J&#39;Ning makes me feel embarrassed, y&#39;know?&rdquo; Stella smiled. Yurei&#39;s initial impression of Stella was quite modest, appearing that she was quite mature for her age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Though 22, Stella enjoyed Yurei&#39;s playful and carefree personality. She always wanted to go back to the time where one could be free and do whatever they wanted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To be honest, I don&#39;t need a babysitter,&rdquo; Yurei stated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s what they all say. What happens if you hurt yourself? Do you know how to cook?&rdquo; Stella argued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well&hellip;about that&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei giggled. Stella&#39;s attention didn&#39;t focus on Yurei, rather a vase that stood on the wooden case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s this vase?&rdquo; Stella asked, inspecting the magical vase with patterns engraved into it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s the unbreakable vase&hellip;It&#39;s untraditionally smaller than others, but it cannot be broken for some reason. I&#39;ve knocked it over at least a dozen times,&rdquo; Yurei explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow. Odd indeed,&rdquo; Stella remarked, placing it back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the day went on, Yurei enjoyed her time with Stella. When Yurei went to bed, Stella took her parents&rsquo; room. As she entered the room, she noticed a pile of papers in the corner, stacked neatly into a pile. It read:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&gt; Riku Tsubasa: ISID Researcher</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Constellation Users</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Date: 03/04/21</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Sylvester Stylar reported that 12 people have received supernatural abilities within the past two days. These people were kids, ranging ages from 14-16 with their sun, moon and rising signs to be the exact same in vedic astrology. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&lt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella sighed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&gt;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The holders Sylvester identified were Pisces, Scorpio and Cancer. Paushe, another global threat has emerged. Please go to Australia and do some research to find the remaining constellation users as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&lt;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella sighed again. She went to bed, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t get laid off again.The next morning, Stella found herself unable to sleep past dawn. Something felt different. The air tasted sharper, cleaner here in Yakushima than it had in Kathmandu, where the city&#39;s pollution often hung heavy in the morning air. She slipped quietly from her room, careful not to wake Yurei who was still sound asleep just down the hallway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The villa&#39;s garden offered a perfect spot for morning meditation. She settled on a stone bench beneath an ancient cedar tree and closed her eyes. She took a much needed deep breath. The morning silence was broken only by birdsong and the distant rush of a mountain stream.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella, are you awake?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella&#39;s eyes snapped open, spotting Yurei watching her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you take the vase?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, no?&rdquo; Stella replied, confused. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then why is the vase in your room?&rdquo; Yurei questioned. Stella stood up, unable to believe her deception.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yurei, I&#39;m telling you, I didn&#39;t touch it! It&#39;s right&hellip;&rdquo; Stella stopped. She had walked to where the vase was originally and it wasn&#39;t there. She stormed back into her room. There the vase stood, in the corner menacingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo; Stella watched in fear. She approached the vase, but it felt different this time around. Instead of a hollow vase, it was filled with darkness. Stella reached in. She was suddenly sucked inside, transporting her into the vase. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hello Stella J&#39;Ning. I am Aquarius. The Vase. I&#39;m unbreakable. This dimension is now yours. Anything living here will rot very quickly except you.&rdquo; a voice boomed. Stella wasn&#39;t amused. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I am Aquarius, like I said. I find you worthy of this vase,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella! I&#39;m going to get you out of there!&rdquo; Yurei dived in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait no, don&#39;t!&rdquo; Stella shouted. It was too late. Yurei entered the vase. Stella swam through the darkness and grabbed Yurei tightly, attempting to leave the vase.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Let me out, stupid vase!&rdquo; Stella demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; the vase hissed, tipping itself over. The darkness dripped out the mouth of the vase as it laid sideways on the ground, a constant stream of nothing pouring out. Stella and Yurei came out of the vase with a thud, crashing onto the wooden floorboards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What was that? Why did you come in?&rdquo; Stella yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Yurei whimpered. Stella sighed and picked up the vase again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That girl that just entered&hellip;such power! Like mine&hellip;&rdquo; the vase echoed. Stella was still dumbfounded. Yurei picked up a small stone and dropped it into the vase. It vanished instantly as the darkness ripped it apart.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, give me that rock over there,&rdquo; Stella asked. Yurei reached for the rock, but somehow she didn&#39;t grab it. Instead, there was a copy of the rock in her hand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&#39;s the hold up?&rdquo; Stella asked. Yurei grabbed the other rock and tossed it into Stella&#39;s hand. As the two identical rocks touched, a small explosion emerged, knocking Stella out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh my god! I&#39;m so sorry Stella!&rdquo; Yurei cried. Stella fell to the ground with a light thud, unconscious. The lights went out, just like when she was in the vase again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella! Are you alright?&rdquo; Yurei asked as Stella awoke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&hellip;happened?&rdquo; Stella asked, her voice weak. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uhm, nothing&hellip;You just passed out suddenly,&rdquo; Yurei lied. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&hellip;am I?&rdquo; Stella asked again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My parents&rsquo; room&hellip;I was just reading the papers my dad had printed&hellip;What&rsquo;s up with this?&rdquo; Yurei asked. Her voice was serious, holding a strong tone of anxiety.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t read that,&rdquo; Stella scowled, snatching the paper away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey! But I&rsquo;m a Gemini&hellip;Do I have supernatural powers?&rdquo; Yurei asked angrily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! Superpowers aren&rsquo;t real. You&rsquo;re delusional. C&rsquo;mon, let&rsquo;s go for a walk&hellip;&rdquo; Stella replied, assuring that the papers had to be made up. But were they? Stella still questioned it as there was a clear website and phone number for the company. International Supernatural Intelligence Division. Truly bizarre. As they began their walk, Stella failed to notice the vase floating behind her, following her everywhere she went. It was able to become an intangible object, prohibiting normal people from seeing and interacting with it unless Stella had held it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They reached a quiet cliff at the end of their walk. Yurei sat down, all cheerful and happy. Stella stood behind her, unable to gain any signal to message her friend. Her responsibility was the only thing at issue here. She was tasked to look after Yurei, and it was going horrible. An incident already? What if Yurei&rsquo;s parents found out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, an overhanging tree branch snapped, falling towards Yurei&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; Stella yelled. Yurei was unable to notice it, the branch rotating to directly skewer her head. Stella leapt and tried to reach it, but she was just short. Her heart skipped a beat. She knew if anything were to happen to her, she was the one to blame. Instead of the branch hitting Yurei, it fell into a pit of nothing and silence continued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it Stella?&rdquo; Yurei asked, unharmed. Stella was confused and looked at Yurei. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t hurt?&rdquo; Stella questioned.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are you talking about? Why did you bring the vase with you?&rdquo; Yurei asked. Stella looked at her hand, the vase in her grasp. What had just happened? It felt like the branch had been eaten by the void of the vase. Was it really supernatural?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did the vase save me or something?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah! A branch fell, and I saved you!&rdquo; Stella laughed, thinking she was lying, with a sense of responsibility booming through her voice.. &ldquo;It was so big!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t even hear it&hellip;So you think these magical powers are real now?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I mean&hellip;I am an Aquarius&hellip;It would make sense if I carried a vase&hellip;But why me and not any other? Why were we chosen?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dunno, don&rsquo;t care. These powers are cool!&rdquo; Yurei smiled. She hopped back on the trail, heading home. Stella grinned, a slight sense of happiness slipped through her veins. Somehow, she managed to save her salary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they got back home, Stella packed a small bag.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Yurei asked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;To the store to buy some dinner. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll be home soon,&rdquo; Stella assured, secretly hiding Yurei&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s papers. She took off and soon reached a public phone booth, calling the bizarre number the International Supernatural Intelligence Division had. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;ISID classified, how may we assist you?&rdquo; a voice replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi, my name is Stella J&rsquo;Ning, I want to report a magical vase that is following me&hellip;&rdquo; Stella exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;A magical vase? I will transfer you to the ghost and spirit anomaly line that Sylvester Stylar understands more about. Please hold on,&rdquo; the line went silent for a moment, then a serious and impatient voice waited for Stella&rsquo;s words.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is Stella J&rsquo;Ning I presume?&rdquo; Sylvester asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes. How can I get rid of this stupid vase that is following me around?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The thing is, you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Sylvester&rsquo;s voice boomed with authority, sending a chilling sensation down Stella&rsquo;s spine. &ldquo;I&#39;m presuming you&#39;re an Aquarius, am I correct?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Um, yes&hellip;?&rdquo; Stella replied. Her voice shook.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;May I enquire about your date of birth, correct to the closest to the 30th minute?&rdquo; Sylvester asked sternly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella froze, but obliged, knowing that this may be the only way to rid that vase. &ldquo;February 13th, 1999, 06:30&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So you are one,&rdquo; Sylvester replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? Who am I really?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You were chosen because your sun, moon and rising sign all correspond to Aquarius. This is what is known as a perfect sign. The cosmic energy on Earth has been displaced to grant 12 people in the world their respective Zodiac powers&hellip;That&#39;s at least what I have concluded&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well Stella, it looks like you&#39;re on Yakushima Island. It&#39;s up to you if you want to use your power or not. I am not forcing you, but I&#39;d advise you to watch the international news. Perhaps the one you are looking after knows the answers. Afterall, Aquarians should listen to others sometimes, am I right?&rdquo; the line ended. Stella was speechless. What was this about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Stella hung up the phone with Sylvester, a heaviness settled in her chest. She stared at the vase floating beside her, its darkness swirling like a silent storm. What did he mean about Yurei possibly knowing the answers? Was the girl she was supposed to be protecting somehow involved in all this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Walking back to the villa, groceries in hand, Stella noticed the evening news playing through the window of a local electronics shop. The headline caught her attention immediately: </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Unexplained Weather Phenomena Sweeps Across Mongolia.&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The footage showed violent windstorms destroying villages, with witnesses claiming they could hear laughter in the gusts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Paushe,&quot; Stella whispered, remembering the name from Riku&#39;s papers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When she returned to the villa, Yurei was sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring at two identical pencils.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Stella asked, setting down the groceries.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yurei jumped slightly. &quot;Nothing! Just... thinking.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;About those powers you think you have?&quot; Stella placed the vase on the table, watching it carefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yeah,&quot; The identical pencil exploded upon touching the original one. Stella wasn&#39;t surprised but happy for once. &quot;Cool, right? So what can you do with that vase?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella hesitated, then reached for the vase. &quot;It&#39;s like...the void. It eats anything that goes inside.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I knew it!&quot; Yurei pumped her fist. &quot;We&#39;re like superheroes!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;No, we&#39;re not,&quot; Stella snapped, more harshly than she intended. &quot;These powers are dangerous. Your parents... they&#39;re researching people like us.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yurei&#39;s expression darkened. &quot;I know. I&#39;ve seen Dad&#39;s files before. They never tell me anything, but I&#39;ve known something was strange for months. That&#39;s why they&#39;re always traveling, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella nodded slowly. &quot;I think so. And I think something bad is happening. Something connected to all this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;The news,&quot; Yurei said quietly. &quot;Mongolia. That&#39;s where they went after Australia, not the other way around. I saw Dad&#39;s itinerary.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What?&quot; Stella felt her heart race. &quot;But that means...&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;My parents might be in danger.&quot; Yurei stood up, determination hardening her features. &quot;We have to go find them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Stella said firmly. &quot;I was hired to keep you safe, not drag you into danger.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;They&#39;re my parents!&quot; Yurei shouted, creating copies of herself in her agitation. The copies flickered and disappeared as she calmed herself. &quot;Besides, if what that vase told you is true, and I have powers too, maybe we&#39;re meant to help.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella paced the room, the vase floating alongside her. &quot;This is crazy. You&#39;re fourteen!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;And you&#39;re only twenty,&quot; Yurei countered. &quot;But that Sylvester guy contacted you for a reason. What if we&#39;re the only ones who can stop whatever&#39;s happening?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, the TV flickered on.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Unnatural tornadoes and hurricanes destroy villages in Mongolia and meteorologists predict that it is headed towards Russia,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You heard Sylvester&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei added quietly. &ldquo;If we don&#39;t do anything, my parents might get caught in the mess&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella looked at Yurei. No longer just a charge to babysit, but someone caught in the same bizarre fate as herself. She thought about Sylvester&#39;s words again: &quot;Perhaps the one you are looking after knows the answers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;If we do this,&quot; Stella said slowly, &quot;we follow my rules. No heroics. Got it?.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yurei&#39;s face lit up. &quot;Really? We&#39;re going to Mongolia?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m probably going to regret this,&quot; Stella muttered. &quot;But yes. Pack only what you absolutely need. We leave tomorrow. Are you scared?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;A little,&quot; Yurei admitted. &quot;But also excited. I&#39;ve always felt... different. Like I was waiting for something to happen. Did you ever feel that way?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella thought about the string of dead-end jobs, the restlessness that had plagued her for years. &quot;Yeah, I guess I did.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Maybe this is what we were waiting for,&quot; Yurei said, her eyes bright with purpose. &quot;Maybe we&#39;re supposed to be heroes after all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The two arrived at the airport the next morning, preparing to fly to Chinggis Khaan Airport.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As their plane soared toward Mongolia, the vase flew beside them, humming a hypnotic but rhythmic tune from inside. Stella watched Yurei sleeping peacefully beside her. She had promised to protect this girl, and now they were flying into the eye of the storm. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The rushing slopes and jagged mountains painted the roof of the world as the pinnacle of peace, with gentle winds and whispering zephyrs passing throughout the creeks and valleys. Clyde meditated outside his home, listening to the sky.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Something cut the silence that Clyde was used to, a projectile ripping through the fractured sky. What was it? He ignored the threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The arrow paused in space, halting before reaching Clyde. Something was different. An energy that Clyde had never felt before. An aura so strong had emerged, and Clyde felt the presence of it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The eyes of the sniper narrowed. But Clyde&#39;s opened. He nudged the arrow in the other direction, almost like he knew how to control this spatial ability. Was this the Buddha&#39;s work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He gave the arrow a light flick, releasing the stored energy it had. It had gained significant potential energy while paused in motion, allowing it to travel extremely fast back towards the sniper, taking him out instantly. It was quick and silent. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you working for?&rdquo; Clyde whispered, closing his eyes again. &ldquo;Why target one of the greatest monks when you already know the battle is lost?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His powers were so subtle that he didn&rsquo;t mind it. In fact, he appreciated it. Did the Buddha really grant him such supernatural power to enter and manipulate the kinematics of any object? He returned to his meditation once again. Forever at bay, forever would he achieve peace and tranquility.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, the monastery bells rang through the valley, signaling a message. Clyde reluctantly opened his eyes, his meditation interrupted once more. A young monk approached, bowing respectfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Master K&#39;lipso, an urgent message from Elder Tenzin. He carried a message about a great disturbance in the balance. He requests your presence in Mongolia immediately,&rdquo; the monk explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why the hell is Tenzin in Mongolia?&rdquo; Clyde asked, skeptical.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;But he wants you&hellip;Maybe it&rsquo;s a test or something&hellip;&rdquo; the monk replied, scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Clyde nodded solemnly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fine. Only because I don&rsquo;t feel something is right. I can sense an imbalance as well. I just wanted peace, but I&rsquo;ll listen to that old geezer,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed. Whatever power had granted him these abilities was also tugging him northward to Mongolia. Within hours, he had packed his meager belongings and begun the journey through the mountain passes toward the Mongolian steppes. The winds seemed to whisper warnings as he traveled, carrying with them hints of an ancient power awakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As he rode stowaway on a truck, he soon reached Mongolia. In a small town, Elder Tenzin rested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Master&hellip;How are your travels?&rdquo; Clyde bowed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;It is a pleasure to see you K&#39;lipso&hellip;&rdquo; Tenzin began. His voice croaked, filled with uncertainty. &ldquo;It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Did you feel a surge in energy within you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes? Did you too, master?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, but I can sense imminent danger coming towards you&hellip;And I can understand why you were chosen&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Chosen? What do you mean &lsquo;chosen&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I believe you were born under the stars of Libra, marking all three of your major houses the same sign&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My sun, moon and rising&hellip;All Libra?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Indeed&hellip;&rdquo; Tenzin smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How do you know all this?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I was notified by an International agency requesting my knowledge&hellip;Anateros was the name I believe&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Anateros? Never heard of them&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Anyhow, you must go towards Russia. I can feel its body crossing,&rdquo; Tenzin finished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, I&#39;ll see you soon!&rdquo; Clyde bowed again, formally leaving the village and continuing on the journey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe was close. She was nearing Russia, on the edges of Mongolia. She felt the solar underlord, Ashwine&rsquo;s presence. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My dear Ashwine, when we unite, we will be unstoppable&hellip;Your flare and flames casted into the sky by my currents, burning and incinerating everything to a mere crisp&hellip;Oh, the days!&rdquo; Paushe dreamt. She longed for another underlord after her 2000 year slumber. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella and Yurei had finally landed after a gruelling flight, where Stella was unable to get any comforting rest. Unlike Yurei who slept like a baby, Stella was exhausted. Her brain was fried, but they had to journey on and defeat the threat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">They paid a driver to take them to one of the more northern villages in Mongolia where it was near the Russian border. It was during the car ride that Stella finally dozed off quietly, able to somewhat energise back up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they stepped off into the village, for miles ahead all they saw were plains and mountains. It was truly a magnificent sight to see. They began to walk towards the border by foot now since it was only a short journey, approximately 5 kilometres.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they walked, a silhouette emerged from the horizon, growing closer and closer. A boy dressed in navy robes approached, with religious looking jewellery adorned on his wrists and body. The boy didn&#39;t look a day older than 16, and Stella was suspicious the moment she saw him all alone in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Stella yelled. &ldquo;Are you my enemy? Are you a threat?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Clyde laughed. &ldquo;You&#39;re a superhero?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;How old are you? 16?&rdquo; Stella scolded, acting tough like a fully grown adult. She knew she had authority seeing such a young boy in the middle of nowhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What gives you the idea that you can order me around? Do you even know who I am?&rdquo; Clyde shouted. Stella wasn&#39;t having any of this. She ran towards Clyde, attempting to shut him up. All she had in her mind was that Clyde was the enemy here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">With a single touch of his finger, Stella froze in motion, the vase hovering over Clyde&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice vase, stupid bitch,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed, walking away. Yurei stood there baffled, terrified to even fight Clyde. &ldquo;Hey, are you okay? That woman seems crazy,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;m fine actually. She&#39;s my babysitter apparently, thanks for shutting her up,&rdquo; Yurei thanked, grinning in laughter. Clyde chuckled alongside her, watching her frozen in motion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ah, I guess I can&#39;t leave her there all day,&rdquo; Clyde sighed, snapping his fingers. Stella returned to normal, tripping over face first into the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You fucking brat! I&#39;m going to kill you!&rdquo; Stella roared. Clyde closed his eyes, ignoring Stella and remained calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella! Calm down! He&#39;s not the enemy&hellip;I think he&#39;s an ally&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, it took you both long enough to figure it out. I thought Aquarius and Gemini were some of the brightest signs, y&#39;know?&rdquo; Clyde smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Yurei frowned. &ldquo;So you&#39;re a Libra?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yep, all Air Signs. Dunno how fate joined us up together though,&rdquo; Clyde remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh, cause I am fate!&rdquo; a voice boomed. A sudden gust of wind swept the three up, separating them. &ldquo;The wind is fate and I will carry you to your destinies!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;s Paushe for you!&rdquo; Clyde explained calmly, undisturbed by the wind power. Clyde landed miraculously on his two feet, while Yurei and Stella tumbled down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Clyde began to close the distance, trying to regroup with Stella and Yurei. As he approached, Paushe took notice of Stella.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Stella motioned. Yurei barely grazed Paushe, able to duplicate and strike an explosion on Paushe, displacing her only slightly. Stella swung her vase at the centre of the explosion, trying to catch Paushe off guard. But she wasn&#39;t there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&hellip;You want to challenge me?&rdquo; Paushe exclaimed from behind, beginning to cast a large gust of wind. &ldquo;Well, let&#39;s fight, girl!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella and Yurei didn&#39;t even notice when Paushe had gotten there. Clyde jumped behind them, forming a sturdy formation to attack Paushe. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe&#39;s arms charged and winded up, ready to release the wind. The group remained steady under the heavy currents, trying their best to stay balanced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe turned into a current, following the charge of wind she blew towards the group, speeding like fragments of shattered glass that pierced through the air.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Stella was dumbfounded. A current? And she was targeted first? The cuts gushed deep, but not fatal on her legs, causing minor setbacks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yurei tried her ability, unable to copy Paushe&#39;s current. She understood her limitations now of only duplicating physical objects, but still, she kept trying to touch her when she came back to her physical form.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Clyde realised his power was useless against a current that could freely move around as air wasn&#39;t an object that travelled through space. It was everywhere, all at once.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The three were obviously extremely uncoordinated, unable to understand or accept each others&rsquo; powers properly. All they had in mind was their own safety. Not anybody else&#39;s, but their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe was untouchable. Though she could instantly kill all three of them by entering their bodies, she knew that she had to be careful of Stella&#39;s vase. It was a one way ticket to her death.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Taste my wind!&rdquo; Paushe giggled. She struck first, creating another large gust of wind. She then leapt up, transforming into her current form again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">But this time, the group dodged, the currents missing them. Paushe squirmed blindly, attempting to hit them but to no avail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where did you brats go?&rdquo; Paushe yelled, traversing the currents. Suddenly, the real wind swept from behind, hitting them in all directions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait! It&#39;s the wind! She&#39;s not using the wind to attack or to cut us, it&#39;s allowing her to see!&rdquo; Clyde exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Yurei yelled. &ldquo;You are actually driving me crazy! I can&#39;t concentrate!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yurei thrashed around, causing multiple explosions around them. She was throwing a tantrum.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yurei, stop! You&#39;re making a mess!&rdquo; Stella ordered, slapping her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo; Yurei snarled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wait, Yurei! Keep making more explosions!&rdquo; Clyde asked, his senses coming to a realisation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Huh? You sure?&rdquo; Yurei asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! Hurry up!&rdquo; Clyde&#39;s voice was tense, his actions were slow and calculated. As Yurei kept duplicating objects and exploding them around, Stella was fuming. The smoke emitted from the explosions had formed and caused a shift in the wind and Stella finally noticed. They could see the current at last.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Paushe was clearly visible. She moved faster than the rest. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;ll kill you!&rdquo; Stella roared, sprinting towards the current with her vase. The currents were still circling the trio, and the lower currents sensed Stella&#39;s motion. Paushe knew where she would exactly be, dodging the hit. The currents grew faster and Stella missed. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The currents had begun to form a tornado with Paushe somewhere in the mix. The smoke had slowly started to fade. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We got to do this fast!&rdquo; Yurei exclaimed. &ldquo;I don&#39;t have much to work here!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Clyde realised that they were cornered. But then something clicked. Paushe must be on the lower parts of the tornado in order to hit them. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella, there!&rdquo; Yurei motioned. Paushe was spotted once again. This was their only chance. Stella rushed over, her movements calculated. She pounced like a tiger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! I read you!&rdquo; Paushe&#39;s voice whispered through the currents. Stella&#39;s eyes widened, realising she missed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, you are the one being read,&rdquo; Clyde sighed, holding Stella&#39;s leg. She froze in motion, her body&#39;s position further back than what Paushe had anticipated. Paushe was travelling at such high speeds that she couldn&#39;t even react to Stella&#39;s displacement. How did she not see that Clyde was going to freeze Stella? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;WHAT? NOOOOO&hellip;MY BREATH! I CAN&#39;T!&rdquo; Paushe wailed, her voice fading into the abyss. Clyde released his grip on Stella, allowing her to move again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank me later, saved both your asses,&rdquo; Clyde scoffed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why&#39;d you touch me like that? You&#39;re so annoying,&rdquo; Stella scowled. &ldquo;Your name&hellip;it hurts to even speak of it,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So what? It&#39;s going to be dispersed by the wind. It won&#39;t hurt,&rdquo; Clyde reassured. The tornado faded and everything went silent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;We make a great team guys,&rdquo; Yurei commented, interrupting the silence. Stella and Clyde laughed synchronously, unable to hold it in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;As if!&rdquo; Stella remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;But&ndash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oi! Do you all forget why we are all here?&rdquo; Clyde exclaimed. &ldquo;Stella, aren&#39;t you the oldest in the group? How come you aren&#39;t mature for your age?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Shut up! You&#39;re one to say being the only guy in the group,&rdquo; Stella grumbled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Stella&hellip;I hate to say this but I see you as a big sister in some way&hellip;&rdquo; Yurei added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Stella&rsquo;s voice softened, and something clicked. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;I think you make a great babysitter&hellip;Maybe we can be a team, can&#39;t we?&rdquo; Yurei suggested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That&#39;d be my dream too!&rdquo; Clyde added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, who asked for your input?&rdquo; Stella scoffed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! Clyde, join us!&rdquo; Yurei smiled. She held her hand out, and Clyde gladly accepted her invitation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, fine I guess&hellip;I do have to admit, that was smart of you,&rdquo; Stella remarked. As the group walked together, they laughed happily together. A relationship was unnaturally formed. &ldquo;Let&#39;s go back home, before your parents find out,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Perhaps their journey wasn&rsquo;t just mere coincidence. Perhaps it was fate. And all along, it was the winds that carried their souls together, with it never intending to bring a painful destiny. It was meant to connect them all along.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.lqupupmqr3xw"><span class="c3">IV - A Heart of Stone and Dirt</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The quiet static echoed from the bleachers. The few spectators that came to watch the meager sport of kickboxing were few, but enough to keep Dimitri&#39;s company afloat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke Zemlya wiped blood from his split lip as he stared at the meager stack of rubles in his hand. Five hundred. Not even enough for this month&#39;s rent. The kickboxing hall was nearly empty now, just the janitor mopping up sweat and, possibly, some of Locke&#39;s blood from the mat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You fight good, Locke,&quot; his manager Dimitri said, lighting a cigarette. &quot;But not good enough. You need to be great to make money in Russia.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke shoved the bills into his pocket. Three fights in one night and this was all he had to show for it. His ribs ached where his last opponent had landed a vicious roundhouse. At twenty-eight, he was already feeling too old for this life. Too battered, too poor, with too few prospects.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Listen, I have friends in Bratva, you can use your strength to help them. What do you say?&rdquo; Dimitri asked. Locke remained silent. He didn&#39;t want anything to do with drugs. &ldquo;Think about it, call Peter if you do,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dimitri shoved a small business card with Peter&#39;s number on it, leaving Locke to do the rest. Dimitri walked into the shadows, disappearing from the night. Then, all but was left was silence and the stoic Locke Zemlya.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this&hellip;&rdquo; Locke mumbled, his hands shivering. He dialled the number and left the stadium.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynette Florange was a perfectionist. She was the type of girl that would worry excessively. She was a lovely girl with an insatiable charm, undeniable for many men. She giggled into the microphone, her eyes locked into the digital screen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why are you laughing Lynn?&rdquo; Jasper asked. Jasper Stenn was perhaps Lynn&#39;s best friend, perhaps even her girlfriend might say. They had been talking online for the last 3 hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just can&#39;t believe you&#39;re actually finally coming to France,&rdquo; Lynn said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, I can&#39;t keep someone like you waiting forever,&rdquo; Jasper replied. Jasper had lived in Germany his whole life and was ready to move to France to live with Lynn. He believed that Lynn was the perfect girl, her personality and attitude shining bright like the stars. She had just radiated the aura Jasper had been looking for all his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Have you seen the news?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, why?&rdquo; Lynn replied curiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, apparently there&#39;s a bunch of supernatural villains that have come to Earth&hellip;I can&#39;t believe it has come to this&hellip;&rdquo; Jasper explained. Lynn was immediately caught towards what Jasper had said and began digging on the internet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ooh! I didn&#39;t know. Let me see what I can find about it!&rdquo; Lynn smiled. As she scrolled article to article, a consistent name kept appearing alongside a term that always accompanied it. The two words? ISID and Zodiacs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Speaking of Zodiacs Jasper, you&#39;re a Capricorn, right?&rdquo; Lynn asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, but more! I&#39;m a special Capricorn you see? My sun, moon and rising sign are all capricorn!&rdquo; Jasper explained. &ldquo;And when researching your&#39;s, I found you are also quite fascinating!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fascinating? Haha!&rdquo; Lynn chuckled, slightly blushing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jasper began. &ldquo;Your sun, moon and rising sign are all Virgo&hellip;Such a good match as well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn laughed, accidentally knocking over a vase behind her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh shit! I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; Lynn panicked, hearing the vase shatter. As she bent down to pick up the fractured shards, she cut herself. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; Jasper&rsquo;s voice whispered from the speaker.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; Lynn replied, turning back to the vase. Somehow, the vase was back to normal, as if it was never broken. It stood upright on the ground, unharmed. But the cut remained. &ldquo;What the&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Jasper asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I just fixed the broken vase&hellip;with nothing but my hand&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn began. &ldquo;I swear it broke&hellip;You heard it shatter right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Jasper replied. Lynn walked in front of the webcam to present the vase, unbroken. Jasper was shocked. &ldquo;No way&hellip;Is that&hellip;your ability? Virgo&rsquo;s ability?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying&hellip;I&rsquo;m one of them? Should I call the ISID?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No. Don&rsquo;t do anything. I&rsquo;m coming to France. Stay still, I&rsquo;ll be there tomorrow at noon,&rdquo; Jasper ordered, ending the call. Jasper knew this would begin some kind of threat so he had to protect Lynn at all costs. The world was ready to erupt with chaos, again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Meanwhile, in Iceland, the ground shook. The ground cracked, a figure emerging. The townsfolk and local residents were terrified, the unknown entity reshaping the land.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry humans for disturbing your peace,&rdquo; Chaitra apologised. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry? You completely destroyed our town!&rdquo; a local yelled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, I can help fix it.&rdquo; Chaitra explained, using his powers to restore the land. &ldquo;You see, I am a warrior of the Earth, I can control rocks that are of pureness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chaitra took the rocks beneath the Earth and remodelled the ground, shifting the landscape to be more flat, removing all large debris.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;I mean&hellip;that&rsquo;s impressive&hellip;Thank you&hellip;&rdquo; locals thanked, appreciating the warrior&rsquo;s attitudes. Chaitra began to recall the events 2000 years ago, with hazy visions of 12 constellations raining justice from the cosmos. Malvorr. That impudent traitor. He created 12 strange cosmic forces that concentrated to seal the other underlords along with the kings away. But that seal was now gone. And Chaitra, one of the most respected underlords, was awake, again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When Chaitra requested to travel to Europe, the locals aided his journey, paying for his plane ticket. Of course, Chaitra hated flying, the thought of travelling through the sky in a tubular vehicle made him sick. He puked at least 3 times. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is sick!&rdquo; Chaitra exclaimed as he landed in England. As he stepped out of the airport, he overheard some news about a recent, unexplained earthquake. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Not by me, surely, heh.&rdquo; Chaitra spat. Of course, the only person that could shift the tectonic plates was him, and perhaps it was the plane ride that made him accidentally move them without notice. Chaitra of course ignored it, claiming it as an accident for such a terrible experience. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Excuse me young man,&rdquo; a stranger asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Young man? Me? Oh my!&rdquo; Chaitra laughed, blushing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, you! Do you know the way to this warehouse?&rdquo; the stranger asked again.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m a tourist,&rdquo; Chaitra replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you have a phone? Mine is dead.&rdquo; the stranger replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a phun&hellip;phone?&rdquo; Chaitra asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dammit, your looks are really a deception&hellip;you&rsquo;re older than you look old geezer&hellip;&rdquo; the stranger remarked, walking off frustrated. What was a phone? Chaitra was still confused. What had humans achieved in just a mere 2000 years? Whatever it was, Chaitra pushed it aside and considered it insignificant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The stranger moved to an alleyway, outside Chaitra&rsquo;s vision. But an unsettling aura emerged from the stranger. Chaitra could feel such a strong, indomitable force from him, his muscular structure screaming &ldquo;I am a warrior&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Locke Zemlya&hellip;&rdquo; a voice whispered. Chaitra decided to overhear the two. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for forgetting to provide you with information. The location of the warehouse is in Limoges, France.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll head over.&rdquo; Locke grunted, handing the man a bag of goods. A handful of green slips were exchanged and Chaitra was curious. Chaitra barged into a random shop, with a large glistening sign displaying the word &ldquo;GUCCI&rdquo; and walked up to a salesperson.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I want a handful of thin green strips or what not, with a bag of white stuff!&rdquo; Chaitra demanded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;ll have to ask you to leave. We cannot tolerate behaviour like that,&rdquo; the salesperson asked. Chaitra looked confused but obliged, leaving the store in frustration. Chaitra wandered the streets in his unique attire, catching the eyes of local residents. People thought lowly of him, believing his oversized robe and fibre strips were something otherworldly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was predetermined that Chaitra would return to the airport once last time, strongly remarking that this was his final time to ever ride an airplane. He wanted to get to France. It wasn&rsquo;t just to explore, but an opportunity to challenge that man with the mystical aura. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke soon arrived in France. It was a nice change of scenery for him, the weather now finally warm and peaceful. He had never felt such calmness in a city where millions called home. The gentle breeze swept against his rigid body, towering like an indomitable wall. Locke was determined to finish the job. He needed this money. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Outside the airport, the air was clean. Another silhouette stepped into view. This time, Jasper had arrived. He perceived Paris as a place where people ate the finest of foods, a place where French cuisine was at its pinnacle. He had always wanted to try the exquisite foods, especially with Lynn. It felt realistic for a first date and he was going to go through it. Then, a familiar voice rang in his ear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Jasper!&rdquo; Lynn shouted. Jasper&rsquo;s face lit up as he saw Lynn, rushing over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Watch it man!&rdquo; Locke exclaimed as Jasper almost ran into him. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jasper replied, navigating his way to Lynn. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Say, do you know how to get to this place?&rdquo; Locke asked, turning to Jasper and Lynn. Jasper and Lynn, initially skeptical of helping, decided to help Locke anyway despite him asking nicely. It was second nature to just help those who needed it and Lynn knew where the location was. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke soon departed, greatly thanking Lynn for her help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey Locke, if you need help, just call me!&rdquo; Lynn offered, writing her number on a piece of paper. Jasper didn&rsquo;t think much of this interaction, knowing that Lynn was just a kindhearted girl who would go out of her troubles to help others. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Thank you lots, I greatly appreciate it,&rdquo; Locke replied, waving goodbye. He got into a rented vehicle and drove off. The warehouse became larger as Locke approached, its metallic exterior extruding out from the landscape of Saint-Gervais. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Alan&hellip;It&rsquo;s me, Locke,&rdquo; Locke shouted. His voice reverberated through the warehouse, but all that replied to him was his echo, then silence. No one was there. Locke marched forward carefully, with each step being fragile and with purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Freeze! We were informed about a drug trade here. Put your hands where I can see them!&rdquo; Police officers had surrounded Locke from behind. Locke slowly turned, trying to reason. The officers thought differently and interpreted his sign of turning as a method of attack, instantly shooting. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke&rsquo;s instincts forced him into his only defence pose, the x pose. Miraculously, he wasn&rsquo;t injured, rather the police fell like dominoes with bullet holes in their bodies, blood spewing out with flesh gushing out. The scene was grotesque, so Locke fled, knowing that the deal he was promised was all a setup. No one cared about him. No one had any respect for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jasper and Lynn had a romantic date, spending time at a fancy restaurant and eating fresh seafood. Caviar, with other exotic foods was a first for Jasper and he savoured every moment and cherished every bite he took. It was a new experience. As dessert came around, Lynn received a call.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hold on, let me take this call real quick. I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; Lynn replied. &ldquo;Hello? Lynette Florange speaking?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey Lynn, it&rsquo;s me Locke. Uhm, I know this is a terrible time but do you know where a good hotel is?&rdquo; Locke asked. While the two continued their call, a mysterious presence trudged along the road where Lynn and Jasper were dining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was none other than Chaitra, drawn towards Jasper and Lynn&rsquo;s mysterious auras. Were there more of these magical humans? Chaitra had to challenge them. He hadn&rsquo;t had a fight in ages. But first, he needed to feast. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? This menu is exorbitant!&rdquo; Chaitra exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sir, what are you going to order?&rdquo; the waitress asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is ridiculous!&rdquo; Chaitra demanded. &ldquo;Give me some bread!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The waitress brought a bowl of bread to Chaitra where he feasted quietly while the other customers watched in irk. Lynn couldn&rsquo;t help but notice Chaitra&rsquo;s unusual habits, unable to take her eye off him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What a poor guy&hellip;can only afford some bread&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ignore him. You&rsquo;re going over,&rdquo; Jasper whispered, trying not to draw attention. But Lynn didn&rsquo;t listen. Suddenly, Chaitra stood up and snapped the table apart, throwing the tabletop away. A waitress rushed over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Sir, what is the matter?&rdquo; the waitress asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is the matter? Are you trying to kill me? There was a bug in the food! It reminds me of scum and mold, something I haven&rsquo;t seen in 2000 years!&rdquo; Chaitra yelled. Lynn being the perfectionist she always was, touched the table, allowing it to restore to its original form. The table was fixed and Chaitra watched in disbelief. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bright young lady, I have to say. Wanna spar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Here? Hell no!&rdquo; Lynn exclaimed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Then the park?&rdquo; Chaitra offered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fine. But you&#39;re easy!&rdquo; Lynn smiled. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As they transferred to the nearby park, Chaitra began first. At first, Lynn saw Chaitra as an easy target. She was immediately rendered wrong. Jasper watched in terror as Chaitra pulled out two massive boulders from the earth, aimed directly towards Lynn. She stood no chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Surrender now or I will proceed to kill you. Do you wish to continue like a noble warrior, believing that death in battle is the only way forward?&rdquo; Chaitra announced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Lynn stepped back in terror, away from the two humongous rocks that were ready to squish her. She couldn&#39;t be the valiant hero, she was nothing but a mere coward.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jasper entered next, not evening knowing his own power. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is this terribly strong presence I sense?&rdquo; Chaitra questioned. Jasper was confused and gazed at Chaitra.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, Chaitra felt darkness surrounding him, unable to move. As his senses returned, he found himself in a black dimension, with glistening white barriers in strange formations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is this illusion?&rdquo; Where is the truth?&rdquo; Chaitra demanded. He tried to use his powers, but nothing worked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I guess you&#39;re in my playground&hellip;This is my domain!&rdquo; Jasper yelled, guessing his own abilities. He had seen similar abilities like this in his favourite game, league of legends where champions could trap and duel enemies in an alternate space.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jasper could feel Chaitra&#39;s power being strained from him, now seeping into himself as strength. No, it didn&#39;t grant him his abilities, rather just enhanced strength based on his powers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This feels&hellip;amazing!&rdquo; Jasper pounced towards Chaitra, landing an elbow then a kick. Chaitra smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nice moves. I respect that,&rdquo; Chaitra remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What? You tryna win via flattery?&rdquo; Jasper scoffed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Fight like a warrior! No time to talk!&rdquo; Chaitra shouted, knocking Jasper back with a kick. Chaitra followed, his physical strength still empowering Jasper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Jasper froze. Though Chaitra was imprisoned for 2000 years, he was still far more experienced in combat than Jasper had. Jasper stood little to no chance. Another devastating uppercut followed, instantly rendering Jasper unconscious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The illusion, or in Jasper&#39;s words his domain, was gone. The park was unharmed and the cool evening breeze swept through Chaitra&#39;s short, </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You two obviously have potential, so I&#39;ll give you an offer. Your boyfriend ain&#39;t dead, just passed out,&rdquo; Chaitra offered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&hellip;you won&#39;t kill us?&rdquo; Lynn stuttered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Of course not! What fun is it if a human battles an ant? Of course the fun in fighting is when you have great competition! Only then I can defeat you both with honour!&rdquo; Chaitra explained. &ldquo;So, I&#39;ll give you all exactly 1 year to grow stronger. Then you can challenge me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chaitra plucked his earrings out, then with a quick push against Lynn and Jasper&#39;s necks, the rings attached onto both their aortas. &ldquo;These rings will dissolve in your body and are made from the minerals found in the Earth. It is capable of turning you into stone. The antidotes are on my fingers, which you will get from defeating me in one year. I wish you luck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then, Chaitra disappeared. He sank into the Earth, the rocks carrying him away. Then, a stressed Locke emerged from the darkness. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Lynn, I felt your presence and an overwhelming energy force&hellip;What happened?&rdquo; Locke panicked. He saw Jasper passed out on the soft and damp grass.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;He&hellip;the&hellip;rock guy&hellip;he&#39;s powerful&hellip;&rdquo; Lynn&#39;s voice was weak and she was stuttering as if she had seen a ghost. Just the thought of Chaitra haunted her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke sighed, his eyes narrowing. &ldquo;I&#39;ll avenge both of you. Myself.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No, please! Locke, you don&#39;t know what you are getting yourself into!&rdquo; Lynn cried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, I may be walking in blind, but that doesn&#39;t cover my resolve. I&#39;ll do something till I die.&rdquo; Locke smiled, walking quietly away into the night.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">--</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke followed the thick, heavy energy trail Chaitra had emitted, following him to the Loire Plains. It was such a bizarre spot, but the energy dispersed there and Locke believed it was where Chaitra was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;And you are?&rdquo; Chaitra began. He stood quietly behind Locke&#39;s car, leaning on the trunk. &ldquo;Your energy&hellip;It feels familiar&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You must be Chaitra&hellip;&rdquo; Locke grumbled, slamming the car door shut.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You don&#39;t answer questions with questions&hellip;&rdquo; Chaitra smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Locke Zemlya. I&#39;m here to avenge my friends.&rdquo; Locke stated, his voice firm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I do warn you, I won&#39;t go easy on you. Despite the fact that I held back with your friends, I did promise that I&#39;d only rematch with them, not you. I will kill you.&rdquo; Chaitra explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&#39;m the toughest competition you will ever have&hellip;&rdquo; Locke mumbled. His voice was tense, his tone serious and gritted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh? Then let&#39;s have a battle to show it! Let&#39;s begin!&rdquo; Chaitra announced, beginning to attack. He crushed two rocks together, trying to flatten Locke like a pancake but he dodged. Locke sneered. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is with your confidence? I&#39;ve never seen anything like this! Most challengers fear me. I do have to respect you for that&hellip;&rdquo; Chaitra remarked. Locke chuckled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Earth slam!&rdquo; Chaitra yelled. Locke kept his distance, knowing that he didn&rsquo;t stand a chance at close range, despite himself as a prodigy kickboxer. He stepped back, unbeknownst to him it was a trap. &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">A meteor had begun falling from the sky. Chaitra had planned this, knowing the meteor belt was just nearing these plains. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Just what was this guy&rsquo;s range? Locke thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Locke watched the meteor fall, unable to think properly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You see, meteors are pure rock and I have full control over them. I&rsquo;m sorry Locke, but you were truly a great fighter. I almost thought I&rsquo;d lost that to be honest,&rdquo; Chaitra commended.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The meteor pierced through the atmosphere, creating a devastating trail of fire. It began speeding faster and faster, directly aimed towards Locke. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not done!&rdquo; Locke yelled as he leapt towards the meteor. He had remembered. He also possessed an ability. He just didn&rsquo;t realise it. He remembered when he was shot by the police before. He had reflected the bullet. It was indeed his favourite x-guard pose. It had something special about it. No, it wasn&rsquo;t any flashy ability anyone had, but one of the most useful abilities he could wish for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As the meteor struck Locke, Chaitra took a deep breath. He clapped, even a tear falling from his eye. He was truly pleased and astonished by Locke&rsquo;s sense of sportsmanship and his fighting skills, identifying him as a &ldquo;true&rdquo; man. But it wasn&rsquo;t over. The meteor seemed to draw closer to him. Indeed it did hit Locke, but it had changed directory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Chaitra realised. &ldquo;How did you&hellip;You jumped towards it on purpose, to change its trajectory?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes! And it&rsquo;s more powerful I believe&hellip;Thanks to you now you are assured dead. I do have to commend you for being such a worthy opponent. I&rsquo;ve never had a fight like this before. You&rsquo;ve pushed me to my absolute limits. I thank you for that!&rdquo; Locke smiled. The rock was now touched and rendered impure, and Chaitra had no way of controlling it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Chaitra stood there, jaw unhinged and wide open. He was wonderstruck. He had never seen anything this glorious before and Locke had embodied what it truly was to be a man. To never give up. Locke&#39;s ability didn&#39;t even fully counter him; if he had calculated and coordinated his attacks better, his victory was assured. But he never knew his ability. Neither did Locke.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He realised his fatal error in his own battle, accepting his own defeat. He had no honour left. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry my dear underlords. My time has come. At least I will die in honour&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His arms flailed, kneeling and accepting his fate. Perhaps he wanted someone as strong as Locke to beat him. The meteor struck, absolutely destroying Chaitra. It almost instantly incinerated his body, leaving no trace of life. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is for Lynnette and Jasper&hellip;Though you promised to fight them once they grew stronger, I guess you&rsquo;ll never live to fulfil that promise,&rdquo; Locke grunted towards the pile of ashes. He picked up the special antidotes that weren&#39;t incinerated by the meteor.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It had been done. Locke had beaten Chaitra all by himself. Once crowned as the king of planets, Chaitra was easily defeated by Locke himself. Chaitra&#39;s warrior attitude was something Locke looked up to. Someone as courageous and kind as that, how could they die so easily to a mere human with no experience in fighting, yet his own ability? Perhaps it had nothing to do with honour. Perhaps it depended on love and passion. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Locke returned to France to find Lynn and Jasper, he felt proud of what he had done. Perhaps it was true that someday he would find his true purpose. A purpose so strong that it could reshape the earth, down to the tiniest of details. It&rsquo;s what the planet needed. Grounded, strong and realistic people who had strong motives and clear goals. Nothing of a fantasy, but something more direct and impactful. That is what the earth constellations had believed.</span></p><h3 class="c6" id="h.sopl2h53nn7c"><span class="c3">V - A Gamble of Flame and Flare</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The ice in the far northern reaches of the world began to crack. It didn&#39;t surface much, it rather bathed under the thick ice, entrapped in a solid frozen prison. A scream echoed, slowly aiding the tearing of the ice. He was awakening from the ice. Ashwine was reborn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That stupid traitor&hellip;my flames are all white now!&rdquo; Ashwine erupted, his flaming body now instead of fire, was constructed of ice-like shards that danced with his movements, mimicking that of flames. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine was once considered one of the most lethal underlords, reaching temperatures the same as the sun. His touch was immaculate, able to burn anything to a crisp. The solar energy he had was eternal, but now it was a dense ball of ice. Flaming ice, to be exact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His flames didn&#39;t feel much different, rather it felt more mystical. It was more crisp and his powers felt stronger. He dipped his body into the waters. Instead of being put out, his icy exterior froze the sea he stood on solid, allowing him to walk on water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine chuckled, grinning at his power. It was upgraded from a certain degree, mostly that his flames were now white. Of course, being the underlord he was, he wanted to find his friends. He felt the presence of one calling to him from the core of the Earth, so he began flying towards the voice that sought for him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He first soared the skies and landed in the murky town of J&otilde;hvi, Estonia. It was a small and isolated town, but Ashwine found it quite cozy. However, it wasn&rsquo;t welcoming when he saw a couple walking home, holding hands. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Love&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine mumbled. &ldquo;How do humans need to rely on one another so much&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of course, like the barbarian he was, he ruthlessly took their lives. He couldn&rsquo;t bear to watch anyone be together. But where would he go? He wanted some place quiet and dark, a place where he could think and grow stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Egypt? Perhaps. The Pyramids were definitely a point of interest. He assumed that in a barren wasteland of sand and gold, maybe it was the perfect place to revitalise. But as he travelled, he overheard stories of war and conflict. He was interested, so he decided to see for himself what this fighting was all about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Watch out!&rdquo; men cried. Gunfire littered the streets of Yemen, with UAE forces hidden on the high ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Pathetic humans. Perhaps a god is needed to settle this dispute&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine scoffed. He glided down with his now Golden Flames, gently landing in the midst of bullets. His flames engulfed the firestorm of ammunition, eating each pellet like peas. &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine swiftly murdered the mass, incinerating all bodies in the vicinity. Not even a single trace. Even the snipers in the highest grounds were killed in an instant, their bodies reduced to nothing but a clump of ash. His flames flickered now golden, for the sand imbuing into his fire.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My child&hellip;&rdquo; one whimpered, almost surviving. Ashwine heard the distant voice, quickly finishing him off without further notice. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;This is boring&hellip;Perhaps I will take a nap in Tutankhamun&rsquo;s coffin&hellip;&rdquo; Ashwine sighed, flying to Egypt without a cause. And there he laid, asleep again for another decade after his imprisonment to grow stronger. His flames raged louder and faster the more blood he sought, claiming every soul as a source of fuel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The sun hung high, casting a warm, ethereal glow onto the narrow, dust-worn streets of Arada. The air hung heavy, like a grudge on the window of Samir Najm&#39;s home. No, it wasn&#39;t guilt nor regret, but something he held dear. Everyone dismissed him for clinging to his father&#39;s death for so long. It had already been a decade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir&#39;s father once was a sniper whose life was claimed by the relentless war, existing now only in faded photographs and whispered stories shared by his mother and elderly neighbours. He felt the dust ridden frames, and couldn&#39;t bear to let go of him in mind. He wanted to follow him to respect his legacy and honour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of course, this meant archery had become one of Samir&#39;s greatest hobbies, practising almost every day. Each time he drew his bow, the world would fall silent. His breath was measured, his aim was calculated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When he drew his bow today, it snapped. The worn wooden frame had broken and Samir&#39;s motivations were crushed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ma!&rdquo; Samir exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes, Samir?&rdquo; his mother replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The bow&hellip;&rdquo; Samir stuttered. &nbsp;&ldquo;My bow&hellip;It broke&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Oh no&hellip;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get over it&hellip;&rdquo; his mother comforted, gently holding his hand. &ldquo;My baby, I told you&hellip;Your father had risked his life for the country&hellip;I don&#39;t want my son to die the same way&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir&#39;s expression widened, then sighed. &ldquo;Ma, this is the closest thing I can do to feel one with papa,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I said you can&#39;t keep doing this&hellip;Do you really think your father would want this?&rdquo; his mother snapped. Samir&rsquo;s fists grew with rage, but he clenched his hatred tight, dispelling it throughout his body. Of course, being the kid he was, knew nothing about wars. He didn&rsquo;t even know how his father had died. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Samir trudged along the sidewalks, all he could think about was how he could fix his bow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Come get your readings! Come get your readings! Cheap Tarot or Zodiac readings!&rdquo; a fortune teller announced. The small stall on the entrance of an alleyway stood distinguished, completely unnatural to the stark, grey buildings that sandwiched it. &ldquo;Hey kid, you want a free reading?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir gave the man a discerned look. He was skeptical of his legitimacy, but still sat down at the table covered in a purple cloth. In the end, it was free either way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I sense a great cosmic energy about you!&quot; the teller exclaimed, waving his bejeweled hands dramatically over a deck of worn cards.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Yeah?&quot; Samir raised an eyebrow skeptically, crossing his arms over his chest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;So, when&#39;s your birthday?&quot; the teller asked, shuffling the cards with surprising dexterity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;December 15th,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Time and place?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;07:00, here,&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Arada&hellip;Alright&hellip;That gives me a very unique insight&hellip;&quot; the teller muttered, spreading the cards in an arc across the purple cloth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What is your conclusion?&quot; Samir leaned forward, despite himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Sagittarius rules your sun, moon and rising. Your heart is full of flame, rage and desire. You are destined for success&hellip;Luck is on your side&hellip;That is what I see&hellip;&quot; the teller proclaimed with absolute certainty, tapping a finger on a card depicting a figure with a bow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Success? Lucky my ass! First, my bow broke this morning. What are you talking about?&quot; Samir shouted, slamming on the table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Don&#39;t deny my claims. You will see. The fire will erupt from your heart and let that fire guide your way,&quot; the teller smiled mysteriously, gathering his cards with practiced calm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir walked away in anger. What was that all about? That liar of a fortune teller had deceived him. Or had he? Samir wandered with his head buried in the sand, completely missing the fact that something had happened. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know, your father was an excellent sniper!&rdquo; the teller yelled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir snapped back, marching towards him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare mention my father!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can tell you all about him&hellip;I can sense that you&rsquo;re curious about war&hellip;and perhaps how your father disappeared&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir reluctantly sat down back on the stool, his hands still trembling with anger. He exhaled sharply, trying to compose himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Your father&#39;s spirit is so strong&hellip;I can feel it now&hellip;&quot; the teller stated, motioning with his hands. Samir&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;He had an indomitable spirit, terrific precision and a perfect mind&hellip;You&#39;re not anything like your old man&hellip;but your own spirit is fiery&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;And? How did my father die?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;He isn&#39;t dead.&quot; the teller whispered, his eyes suddenly becoming unfocused as if seeing something beyond the cramped stall.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;What? Nonsense!&quot; Samir scoffed, but his voice betrayed a hint of desperate hope beneath the disbelief.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Well, he&#39;s in a hybrid state. He never fulfilled his goal, so his spirit or soul, some might say remains on Earth&hellip;He died when he was trying to assassinate someone&hellip;someone must have found his spot and brutally gutted him&hellip;&quot; the teller began. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir interrupted him halfway, lunging at him with rage in his voice. He yanked him by the collar. &quot;You don&#39;t know anything about my father! Shut up!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The teller felt a cold and sharp object pressing against his neck from behind. Sweat dripped from his forehead, and his body shivered in terror. Samir coldly pushed the teller back, then left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir walked away and didn&#39;t turn back this time. He muffled the voices and noises that came around, ignoring the presence of the golden tipped arrow following him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo; Samuel exclaimed, throwing his school bag on the ground and slumping onto a seat. His dad was still in his police uniform, and grumbled from the kitchen. He stepped out with a warm mug of coffee in his hand, still looking tired from the night before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey son,&rdquo; his father greeted. &ldquo;How was school?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Great. I got an A+ on my Law test!&rdquo; Samuel smiled, turning on the TV. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Today in the world: Supernatural incidents have been happening across the globe and we&rsquo;ve seen unusual heroes save many casualties. Rumors have that there is another supernatural threat still unattended to, but still unidentified. Any reports to the ISID would be greatly beneficial,&rdquo; the broadcaster announced, beside displaying a figure embodied in white flames. Though only a rough sketch, Samuel was intrigued.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">When his father saw the static image, his arm froze and dropped his coffee. &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Dad! Are you alright?&rdquo; Samuel exclaimed, immediately tending to his aid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;m alright&hellip;Just that image reminds me&hellip;&rdquo; his father remarked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Reminds you of&hellip;?&rdquo; Samuel began, gathering pieces of the shattered mug.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;That night&hellip;when I told you your parents disappeared&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is this about my real parents?&rdquo; Samuel asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;To be honest&hellip;I never really had the courage to tell you&hellip;I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t accept this truth&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What is it? Tell me, dad!&rdquo; Samuel begged.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Well, I believe that fiery figure </span><span class="c5">killed </span><span class="c2">your parents. Your parents never disappeared, but he incinerated them into nothing. Can you believe that? I was on patrol and saw everything unfold, but was too afraid to intervene&hellip;&rdquo; his father explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samuel sat motionless, the broken ceramic fragments still clutched in his hand. The sharp edges dug into his palm, but he barely noticed the pain. &quot;You... saw it happen? All this time you knew?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Officer Magi&#39;s weathered face creased with regret. &quot;I couldn&#39;t explain it, Samuel. Who would believe me? A man made of fire? They would have taken you away from me, put you in the system. I couldn&#39;t let that happen. Your name isn&rsquo;t Samuel Magi, rather Samuel Paike. Perhaps you were too young to remember&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;But all these years...&quot; Samuel&#39;s voice trailed off as his eyes returned to the television screen. The image of white flames seemed to flicker despite being a still photograph. Something stirred in the depths of his memory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His mother had always told him about the importance of having rules. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Rules keep us safe, Samuel. Remember the rules.&rdquo; Those words rang in Samuel&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a Leo, you&rsquo;re the Lion that leads the pack.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Of course, Samuel, like the responsible boy he was, kept quiet about this topic, knowing that his foster father was sensitive towards this information. He kept it a secret, and began researching more about this flame entity. He scoured news archives, paranormal forums, even his father&#39;s confidential police reports when he wasn&#39;t looking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Sam, what are you doing?&quot; Officer Magi asked one evening, entering his bedroom. &quot;What are you doing looking through these old files of mine?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I&rsquo;m worried,&quot; Samuel said worriedly. The words hung in the air between them, soft but bitter. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;You don&rsquo;t need to worry about it, I already told you. Please, let go of this topic,&quot; he said sternly, closing Samuel&rsquo;s laptop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samuel instinctively prevented his father from closing his laptop and suddenly snapped. &quot;No! You will tell me everything you know about that night!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">His words were delivered cold and strong, it sounded like nothing but of a strong conviction Samuel had developed over the past two days. It had completely reconstructed the atmosphere of the room, instead of the warm and cozy vibe, Officer Magi felt a mystical sense of truth and bitterness. No deception, no illusions, but only the truth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;It was March 3rd, 2013. I was relatively close friends with your parents, since I lived next door. It was around 19:00 PM when I was leaving my home to purchase dinner&hellip;I saw a white figure approaching your parents as they walked home&hellip;When they disappeared, the white figure flew off&hellip;that&rsquo;s when I knew you were still alive and scared. I thought you would&rsquo;ve been worried and scared, so I brought you to my house&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samuel stared at his adoptive father in horror. He wasn&rsquo;t scared, nor worried, rather a mix of emotions that flooded him like a tidal wave. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I... I&#39;ve been wanting to tell you for years,&quot; Officer Magi said, blinking in confusion. &quot;I just never found the right moment. Somehow, it felt like the right time now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samuel&#39;s heart pounded in his ears. Had he done that? Had his words somehow compelled his father to speak? Yet his father didn&#39;t seem controlled or manipulated. He had shared the information as if it were his own choice, experiencing the aftermath as natural relief after unburdening a long-held secret.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Dad, I...&quot; he began, but was interrupted by the ringing of his father&#39;s work phone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Officer Magi answered it mechanically, still looking shaken. &quot;Yes? Yes, I understand. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">He hung up and turned to Samuel. &quot;There&#39;s been an incident at the convenience store on Valga Road. The Korov boy again. I have to go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Anton Korov was a teenager just like Sam, but he had a bad reputation for being a notorious criminal in the vicinity. At nineteen, he&#39;d already accumulated a record of petty theft, vandalism, and intimidation. Samuel had encountered him numerous times, including a particularly unpleasant incident last month when Anton had cornered him behind the school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samuel&#39;s mind raced. If what had just happened was real and if his command had somehow forced his father to tell the truth, could he use it again?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; he declared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Officer Magi was too disturbed by his own unexplainable behavior to argue. The drive to the convenience store was silent, tense. When they arrived, Anton Korov was outside, breaking into a car, ready to get away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Fourth time this month!&quot; the owner yelled. &quot;He threatens me, breaks things, steals! And nothing happens!&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Officer Magi rushed to restrain Anton, but as he approached the white Honda, Anton equipped a revolver and shot at point blank range, right into Officer Magi&rsquo;s brain. His body instantly fell backwards and Samuel watched in terror, his adoptive father dead right in front of him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you, nerd? Oh! You&rsquo;re that Samuel kid I beat up! HA!&rdquo; Anton laughed as he started the engine. Samuel was enraged, but his words were spoken with a calm and serious demeanour, filled with conviction. He took a deep breathe, then muttered out the words:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fucking dead&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As Anton drove off with a sinister laugh, his car miraculously crashed into a streetlight. A bloom of orange blossomed from the mangled engine, the air thickening with the acrid smell of gasoline. The car had exploded and all Samuel saw was a disfigured Anton, gasping for his breath. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Debris rained down shortly after consisting of shards of metal, melted plastic and fragments of glass. It was a complete mess, perhaps a call of calamity. The streetlight, now severed at its base, laid like a fallen giant. The tragedy hung heavy in the air, a suffocating blanket of smoke and the unspoken understanding that a life had been extinguished in a flash of light and a roar of destruction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Do you have anything to say, idiot?&rdquo; Samuel yelled as he leant down to confront Anton. &ldquo;Speak, you shitheaded fucker!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;how did this happen?&rdquo; Anton whimpered, his voice frailing. His body limped and his movements grew weak. &ldquo;This&hellip;shouldn&rsquo;t be&hellip;it can&rsquo;t&hellip;be my </span><span class="c5">fate</span><span class="c2">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Nothing is supposed to happen here&hellip;This is my town&hellip;J&otilde;hvi, not yours,&rdquo; Samuel scoffed, looming over Anton. Samuel walked off as if he had nothing to do with the incident, with his mind clear. It was certain he wasn&rsquo;t a normal boy. He had a hidden power that could alter nature, in his mind, he believed that he could create calamity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The streets screeched in a wailing siren paralleled with a light that beamed neon red and blue. There had been an accident. At the nearby soccer field, a fatal tragedy occurred in the last few minutes of play time, when the opponent kicked the ball into Cindi O&rsquo;Luron&rsquo;s face, knocking her out. She was immediately diagnosed with a high fever when she didn&rsquo;t get up for a solid minute, leading to paramedics rushing to the scene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cindi was still asleep, with her fever only rapidly growing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do we do? The medication isn&rsquo;t working and the fact her fever is rising even when she&rsquo;s asleep is terrible!&rdquo; a paramedic asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&quot;Her temperature is still spiking! We&#39;re losing her!&quot; another yelled over the din of the siren.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cindi&#39;s world had dissolved into a chaotic swirl of heat and pain. Her body felt like it was being consumed from the inside out, every nerve ending screaming in protest. She vaguely registered the frantic voices around her, the jarring movements of the vehicle, but it was all distant, muffled, as if she were trapped beneath layers of thick, burning wool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As she was rolled into the clinical hospital, nurses rushed to her side, giving her water. Instead of drinking it, the water began evaporating upon nearing her body, shocking the nurses. Her temperature was high, but no one would have guessed it to be this high, yet enough to evaporate that of even water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do we do?&rdquo; a nurse shrieked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s reached 100 degrees celsius internal temperature! What is going on?!&rdquo; another nurse yelled frantically. But Cindi&rsquo;s heartbeat didn&rsquo;t slow down. It only grew fast. Back on the ambulance it was a mere 60, but now it had risen to 210, mirroring that of her internal temperature.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Her parents rushed into the room, but they were unable to get close to their daughter due to the sweltering heat she produced. They were scared for their daughter, her two brothers were shocked. They couldn&rsquo;t believe their eyes either. What in the world possessed their little sister?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Is she going to be alright?&rdquo; her father asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you think? We don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s going on. Nobody in the world has ever experienced anything like this!&rdquo; the doctor yelled, throwing his clipboard up into the air signalling he had given up. Just as the clipboard hit the ground, a detonation sound clicked in the background. Everyone gazed at each other, not knowing where the sound came from. They were all confused as there was no bomb, or was there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Then in a blinding light, a humongous explosion engulfed the hospital wiping everything and everyone out of sight. The aftermath consisted of flames and a lone silhouette appeared from the building. Cindi survived the incident unscathed, walking out as if she was confused about what had happened. Authorities and Police had surrounded the scene, preventing anyone from coming close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What the heck? How did you survive, little girl? How are you unharmed?&rdquo; an Officer asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Me? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;After I got hit by a soccer ball, I can&rsquo;t recall anything&hellip;&rdquo; Cindi stated honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, Cindi saw familiar faces, those of her soccer friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Mia! Rio!&rdquo; Cindi called out. Mia and Rio rushed over to Cindi&rsquo;s side, panicked and worried.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cindi! What happened?&rdquo; Mia asked, her voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where are your parents?&rdquo; Rio exclaimed, worried filling her voice. Cindi looked behind her at the ashes of the hospital.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Parents? What do you mean? I thought they were still watching the game?&rdquo; Cindi asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No stupid! They went after you! They went into the hospital just a few minutes ago!&rdquo; Rio shouted. Cindi&rsquo;s eyes widened, her heart skipping a beat. Did she just kill her parents, or was that explosion just something else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a monster!&rdquo; a voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You caused the explosion!&rdquo; another exclaimed. A crowd of citizens had begun to gather around, only staring at Cindi in her soccer uniform. She felt innocent, yet dozens of people criticised her for the actions that happened. She couldn&rsquo;t think straight and the very image of her killing her own parents was devastating. She had even killed her brothers. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Step aside! Step aside! Move, you moron!&rdquo; a voice demanded, wading through the dense crowd. An authoritative figure approached the explosion site, dressed in an all black suit with a crimson tie. His hair was silver grey and slicked back, also wearing a rectangular pair of glasses. &ldquo;This is ISID, move away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;ISID?&rdquo; Cindi asked. Mia and Rio quickly scattered into the crowd as the man approached the girl and picked her up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Are you crazy? That girl is a bomb! You&rsquo;re a fucking lunatic!&rdquo; men shouted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll use her as a bomb again if you all don&rsquo;t shut up!&rdquo; the man roared, silencing the crowd. Cindi was immediately charmed by the man&rsquo;s aura, his voice deep and persuasive. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming with me. I know what happened.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Cindi asked, her mind still ringing from the voices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;My name is Jaxton Ozim. I&rsquo;m the founder of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division and I&rsquo;ve identified you as the Aries bearer. You&rsquo;re lucky that you didn&rsquo;t destroy the entire planet. You&rsquo;re one of the most destructive constellations we&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Aries? Destructive?&rdquo; Cindi asked. She was skeptical, but curious.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You see, you&rsquo;re a special girl. Though you&rsquo;ve caused tragedy, you can save tragedy. Your powers to create supernova-like explosions are useful. We&rsquo;ve actually got a global threat on the run and could use someone like you,&rdquo; Jaxton added.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me? Why should I trust you?&rdquo; Cindi asked again, jumping off Jaxton&rsquo;s arms. She could feel that Jaxton was quite muscular and that he had immense strength and training, assuming he was some sort of war veteran turned detective.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll be able to make friends with similar people like you. They have superpowers and I believe you can resonate with them really well,&rdquo; Jaxton smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">---</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine stood up from Tutankhamun&rsquo;s coffin at midnight, feeling an overwhelming presence. He felt three entities drawing closer to him with immense power, not to mention also great resolve. <br></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">While Cindi practised and developed her explosive power in ISID facilities to grow stronger, she began to realise these explosions grew with her anger and stress. She saw immense potential in her, but also a flaw. She had to control these emotions, otherwise the fire would get to her. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Cindi, I&rsquo;d like you to come with me to Estonia. I think I may have found another Zodiac user.&rdquo; Jaxton explained. As they reached the quiet town of Johvi, they met Samuel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Samuel asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re desperate for revenge for your foster father and real parents. Hop in, we could use your help,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hi! My name is Cindi O-Luron!&rdquo; Cindi greeted happily. &ldquo;The International Supernatural Intelligence Division is quite cool, everyone is so nice to me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Cindi couldn&rsquo;t expect what happened next, but Samuel shook her hand in acceptance, following them to the private jet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What are your powers?&rdquo; Cindi asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Dunno. I </span><span>Think</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;it&rsquo;s to do with calamity. I can force people to do things&hellip;but naturally,&rdquo; Samuel explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;So you create </span><span class="c5">rules</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for things?&rdquo; Jaxton asked. Samuel&rsquo;s mind clicked at the word rule. Her mother had always mentioned about rules being rules and he realised the potential of his power. To rewrite actions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yeah, but I&rsquo;m not sure of the limitations on it,&rdquo; Samuel replied.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we have testing facilities. You can test them out however you want,&rdquo; Jaxton smiled.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Their next stop was Arada where they found a depressed Samir sitting on the rooftop, playing with a golden arrow. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re Samir Najm right?&rdquo; Jaxton called out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Samir asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;The International Supernatural Intelligence Division!&rdquo; Cindi and Samuel chanted in unison, then joined together to have a laugh. For some reason, Samir found the interaction funny as well, also laughing at the corny name.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You know how to use that arrow of yours?&rdquo; Jaxton asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Uh, yeah. I&rsquo;ve been hunting for a week or so and collecting bounties in my area. It&rsquo;s overpowered, it can literally go through walls and I can control it with my mind. It&rsquo;s like my second vision,&rdquo; Samir explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go beat the last supernatural entity. His name&rsquo;s Ashwine and he&rsquo;s the white flamed entity,&rdquo; Jaxton explained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;White&hellip;flamed?&rdquo; Samuel asked, almost stuttering. &ldquo;The same that killed my parents?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s why I said you could get revenge,&rdquo; Jaxton reiterated. Samuel smiled, an </span><span>internal</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;flame only growing stronger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Why should I join all of you?&rdquo; Samir interrupted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Because the white flame potentially killed your parents </span><span class="c5">too</span><span class="c2">. There was a report in Yemen saying that hundreds died,&rdquo; Jaxton explained. Samir was still skeptical but saw Samuel and Cindi happy, inviting him to their group. Samir accepted, though only as a friend, not an asset. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ashwine, the white flame, is headed to the Arabian Desert for some reason. Be weary though, he might have increased in power,&rdquo; Jaxton warned. The three constellations were heavy at practise, refining their skills and improving their chemistry in the ISID facilities. For once, the three became close friends, resonating with each others&rsquo; experiences. About tragedy, about guilt, about themselves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">It was high noon when the barren Arabian Desert hummed the golden tune of waste, binding the three fire constellations together. The three had surrounded Ashwine in a triangular formation, finally ready to confront him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;So, that organisation planned this?&rdquo; Ashwine muttered. &ldquo;This will be quick!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine&rsquo;s flames crashed like waves, his body taking the forms of various weapons. From axes to swords to maces, the golden flames only grew larger as he thrashed. Cindi dove for cover as Ashwine&rsquo;s thunderous body crushed the fragile ground, sending terrifying vibrations into the bodies of nearby people. Samuel peeked up from the debris, watching in terror.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Samuel! Don&rsquo;t say the wrong thing! Otherwise we&rsquo;ll never be able to beat him!&rdquo; Samir yelled as he ran towards his position. His voice was distant, but deep. Samuel thought hard. What was Ashwine&rsquo;s weakness? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell him to die. His ability to adapt and shapeshift to situations allows him to redirect my misfortune&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Teamwork? I haven&rsquo;t heard that word in centuries&hellip;To think humans need to rely on others to thrive&hellip;That&rsquo;s just incomprehensible! Ahahaha!&rdquo; Ashwine&rsquo;s voice boomed louder than his flames, his body now igniting past the golden glamour. It had incinerated into something dark, into those of black flames that came straight from hell. The devil&rsquo;s flame had emerged, Ashwine&rsquo;s final and strongest stage. He felt overwhelmed, but he still had enough fuel to push through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine didn&rsquo;t focus on Samuel for some strange reason, instead targeting Cindi. She fought back, but was unable to resist the heat. Cindi exploded, breaking Ashwine&rsquo;s flames and scattering them. As they reformed to create chains, the golden hue darkened, first a burnt sienna, then slowly into a midnight black.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The flames of the devil had awoken, to have rested with Tutankhamun granted him the flames of Anubis, ready to conjure all his strength into pure chaos. The darkened fiery chains tied Cindi up as she struggled to free herself from Ashwine&rsquo;s grasp. His grip tightened, twisting on the soft flesh of her wrists. She squealed in pain. Samuel focused, and prepared his rule.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You will never be able to reform again!&rdquo; Samuel commanded, surprising Ashwine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Ha! As if!&rdquo; Ashwine snickered. He erupted with flare again, changing form into a large hammer. &ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine struck his body down, relentlessly crushing everything in sight. Chaos ensued Samuel, a trail of rampage filling the environment. Cindi got up after being thrown on the ground, her body almost giving up. She ran headfirst, ready to propel herself into Ashwine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Samir motioned, calling for his arrow. Cindi leapt up and began her detonation, sprinting towards Ashwine. Ashwine gazed backwards, stunned at Cindi&rsquo;s courage to tackle him head first. As they collided, a massive explosion ensued, obliterating everything in the small radius. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Again? You saw what happened last time! Bahahaha!&rdquo; Ashwine cackled. His flares flickered, then suddenly froze in motion. &ldquo;Huh? I can&#39;t&hellip;I can&#39;t feel my body&hellip;Why can&#39;t I reform?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Because that&#39;s my conviction&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel yelled boldly. Ashwine&#39;s eyes widened. Where was Samir? &ldquo;I believe you took something I owned&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ashwine demanded. &ldquo;What did I ever take from you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You took my parents&hellip;If it weren&rsquo;t for you&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t hold these grudges&hellip;But you&rsquo;re even lower than human scum!&rdquo; Samuel yelled, kicking Ashwine in the face. The flames flickered, almost dampening out. They were beginning to crack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Ashwine roared, his voice booming across the desert. There was no echo, but silence, then a delayed reaction. Samuel was thrown backwards, as if Ashwine even had control over the smoke the flames emitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Where&#39;s that boy? Where is he?&rdquo; Ashwine panicked, his face being the only piece of himself that was stable. Ashwine&#39;s body was fragmented enough, and having his head vulnerable was already looking pale for him. His flames wimped. His black flames were weakening.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The sun glistened on Samir&#39;s sights, ringing a high pitched whistle. Ashwine&#39;s eyes darted around, scanning for Samir but to no avail. He couldn&#39;t protect himself. He couldn&#39;t reform under Samuel&#39;s rule unless he was knocked out. But he wasn&rsquo;t, he remained calm and slowly stood up in the warm sand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;You are the weakest among all living things&hellip;To have thought someone like you would break our fiery hearts full of courage&hellip;Deserves to endure torture until time ends!&rdquo; Samir&rsquo;s voice echoed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Ashwine&#39;s face went pale and his expression tensed, his body cracking further into even smaller fragments. Fear struck him like a needle, with sharp pains rendering in his expression. Samir&#39;s voice was so terribly cold, all he could do was watch.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; Samir yelled, finally releasing his arrow. It pierced Ashwine&#39;s face, breaking it apart. Each piece tore off like a thin sheet of paper, like glass being compressed under heavy weight. Each piece, individual, now was nothing but a speck of fire that floated in the air. &ldquo;Now, suffer forever&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The air around Samir&#39;s arrow shimmered. With a high-pitched whine that climbed beyond the range of human hearing, the rod carved a furious circle, displacing the air with brutal efficiency. Invisible blades of compressed atmosphere lashed outwards, tearing and displacing every speck of Ashwine&rsquo;s body, gushing each flame into a distant country. It had reached maximum turbulence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;no&hellip;You can&#39;t! I&#39;ll&hellip;!&rdquo; Ashwine cried as his body crumbled, dissolving into the sky. Ashwine&rsquo;s voice faded as each speck grew further apart, his body now dissipated over the Earth&rsquo;s continents. Ashwine had never died, but he was permanently rendered defeated. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Samir&hellip;That was so cool!&rdquo; Cindi exclaimed, congratulating him. Cindi felt happy for her powers for once, enjoying the company Samuel and Samir had provided. She patted Samir on the back who couldn&rsquo;t help but blush.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Yea! Never thought we could beat that guy&hellip;&rdquo; Samuel laughed. He felt relieved and happy he could do something for his parents and Officer Magi. As he looked up into the sky, the clouds took form of those he lost: his real parents, and his foster father. Samuel sighed deeply, knowing that this was the beginning of a new chapter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Good thing you said the right rule!&rdquo; Samir </span><span>joked</span><span class="c2">, laughing back at Samuel. They exchanged laughter and happiness, savouring the moment. As Samir looked towards the blazing sun that hovered over the desert&rsquo;s horizon, he saw a faint smile, a teary eyed man. Slowly, his jaw opened in disbelief. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The image the pastel blue sky had created wasn&rsquo;t an illusion, but a message from the heavens. His father appeared and looked down upon him, his soul free at last. His voice whispered into his ear, like the soft breeze.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Son&hellip;I see your spirit&hellip;You&rsquo;re just like me&hellip;&rdquo; his father muttered. Samir cried, with Cindi and Samuel minding their own business. Samir looked back at the arrow that stood beside him, a hazy, translucent neon orange mirage of his father&rsquo;s soul. He had realised that he never fought this battle alone or with friends. His father&rsquo;s warrior spirit carried on, finishing what he had once started. The arrow was never truly of his zodiac gift, rather the soul of his father. &ldquo;You can keep that arrow, a reminder of me in the afterlife. Like a true sniper, aim for the head!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Samir wept quietly, drawing the attention of Cindi and Samuel. They tried to comfort him, but also grieved and mourned the death of the ones that risked their lives for their success. They knew this was a crucial turning point in their lives, recognising those that had sacrificed themselves for their futures. A fiery heart, a fiery spirit. Never restless, never bashful. They bantered on as teammates, but what burnt was their friendship and blazing spirits that chose to never give up. Samir recognised this moment as growth, a catalyst to only grow stronger. Something told him that he would closely mirror that of his father&rsquo;s, and his legacy would not be forgotten. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
