Jespan Lords, each wielding unique supernatural abilities and ruling over distinct cosmic forces. The party consists of five members:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_44t8fd7n4m5c-0 start"><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Behatar, the Jespan Lord of Strength</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Karana, the Lord of Space</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Sadana, the Lord of Death</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Rukana, the Jespan Lord of Time</span></li><li class="c2 c6 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Lucina, the Lord of Wisdom and Queen of the party</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Together, they governed the planet of Ajespa with immense power and influence, shaping cosmic events and overseeing the balance of their universe, with their ambitions and conflicts deeply intertwined with their roles in the party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.cjgluuiyq107"><span class="c3">I - Love is Fragile like a Paper Heart</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The candied landscape of the sun kissed beaches were immaculate. Though not the most popular location among Malaysia, it was certainly a quiet and serene place to relax.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo; Hazel giggled. &ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun, her boyfriend playfully splashed the cold water onto her, smiling with joy. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel shook her head. She was enjoying the warmth of the sun as she sat on the sheet that lined the sand. The sun cast beautiful golden rays onto her body, covered mostly by her lavender one piece swimsuit. She wasn&#39;t there to tan, but to relieve stress from the academic workload.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Jun ran out from the water and jumped beside Hazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Hazel exclaimed. &ldquo;Get your cold and wet hands off!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun ignored and pressed his lips tightly onto Hazel&#39;s, her eyes immediately softening. Jun&#39;s hands caressed her neck, as Hazel unconsciously pulled his body closer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Hazel giggled as Jun began kissing her neck. Jun looked up at Hazel&#39;s face, locking eyes again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright. Let&#39;s go home. It&#39;s already 3:00pm anyway,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun stood up and dried the remaining water off his body with a towel as Hazel grabbed the rest of the items and packed them neatly into a bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun, dinner sometime after school?&rdquo; Hazel suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure, Friday sounds good to me,&rdquo; Jun replied, tossing his shirt on. The two snuggled together as they rode the bus to their neighbourhood, parting ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day felt eerily gloomy for some odd reason. Perhaps it was hinting at a much sinister force, with the soccer team returning from their trip to Singapore to compete for the National Under 18s Soccer Final. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ryan Song was the team&#39;s alleged leader, always having the strong and commanding voice which ultimately led them to win. He was in control and led the team to success, so no one challenged him. Ever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun my boy!&rdquo; Ryan teased. &ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good, yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Jun smiled nervously, clutching his textbooks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did I miss anything?&rdquo; Ryan asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We have a practical project today in physics,&rdquo; Jun explained. &ldquo;Mineral Conductivity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the boys entered the classroom, they moved to the bench on the side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do have to warn all of you, there is danger in this experiment. Do not do anything stupid!&rdquo; the teacher boomed. The students all listened carefully. The experiment had begun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Minerals were distributed among the students and Jun and Ryan ended up with Quartz and Orichalcum, two rather odd minerals. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why is the Orichalcum glowing?&rdquo; Jun asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dunno. Should be fine,&rdquo; Ryan replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, when I say okay, turn the circuit on, okay?&rdquo; Jun explained. Ryan being the academic failure he was at all the rest of his subjects took his statement quite literally, realising he had said okay straight after.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The electricity shot through the copper wires as Jun&#39;s fingers still held them, lowering them onto the mineral. Ryan&#39;s eyes darted, realising that wasn&#39;t the signal. In panic, he flicked the switch off again, hoping Jun wouldn&#39;t realise. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But the current was strong enough to vibrate the Orchicalcum, conducting an invisible load of energy straight into his brain and completely frying his internals. Jun&#39;s body jolted around as other students began to turn heads, seeing what was happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teacher rushed over to Jun immediately but it was too late. There was no pulse. Emergency services were called.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Hazel sat quietly in the boring mathematics class when suddenly something hit her head, causing her to flinch and wake from her slumber.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel, you alright?&rdquo; the teacher asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, may I use the bathroom?&rdquo; Hazel asked. The teacher nodded with approval, giving her permission to go wash her face in cold water knowing she was asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel thought little of that hit until she returned to her seat to hear ambulances outside the school, hauling a student into one of them. Hazel couldn&#39;t see who exactly it was, but she felt something was off. Something was completely wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Hazel didn&#39;t let it bother her. She continued through class and powered through the rest of the day. The one thing that disturbed Hazel was Jun, she hadn&#39;t seen him all day. Perhaps he was sick, and she just didn&#39;t know about it. Normally, Jun would text her if he was absent, but it was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">On her way home, she stopped by Jun&#39;s house. But there was no answer. When she tried calling Jun&#39;s phone, it was dead on the other end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Crap&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel thought. The last thing she wanted was to believe that it was Jun that was carried away in that ambulance. She had to text Ryan. He was one of Jun&#39;s friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&gt; Hazel: </span><span>have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you seen Jun today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>&gt; Ryan: </span><span>i knew</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you would ask me&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: wdym?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: srsly, idk what ur on abt&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: Have you not noticed that everyone has been secretly staring at you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: ur gonna kill me if i say this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: say what???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: you wont believe me that&#39;s all</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: tell me NOW</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: it really hurts to tell you&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ur making me panic&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Ryan: im really sorry, but i think Jun died today</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: WHAT</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: ???</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&gt; Hazel: HELLO? RESPOND?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s heart stopped for a moment as she reread Ryan&#39;s message. &ldquo;Jun died today&rdquo;. Her breath hitched and it grew faster. She couldn&#39;t hold anything in. Frantically, she dialled Jun&#39;s mother&#39;s phone number, a last resort she had saved in her contacts. It was never for her to use, rather Jun as he would occasionally forget to charge his phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Jun&#39;s mother spoke. Her voice was shaky, almost trembling. &ldquo;Who is this again?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s me&hellip;Hazel&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel stuttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Hazel dear&hellip;you must have heard the news&hellip;&rdquo; his mother cried. Hazel could hear the sadness and grief in her voice, as if Jun had really been in a fatal accident. &ldquo;I&#39;m so sorry darling&hellip;you two were made for each other but still&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel couldn&#39;t help but bang at their house&#39;s door even louder, trying to ease her pain. She struggled to walk, even to her house just 100 metres down. As she reached the door, her mother knew exactly what had happened and helped her in. There was nothing left for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That night she couldn&#39;t sleep. She couldn&#39;t breathe properly. Heck, she wasn&#39;t even able to visit the hospital. It was at 2:00 AM in the morning when Hazel&#39;s eyes lit up for the fifth time, having nightmares on how Jun had died. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She grappled tight to her sheets as goosebumps crawled up her skin, tensing her muscles up. But then, a gentle hand softly navigated her curves, elegantly calming her down. Hazel didn&#39;t even think much of this, her mind was already running that it had no time to process this. But somehow her eyes closed again and for 12 hours straight, she did not dream of a nightmare ever again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A loud yawn and some stretches woke Hazel up the next morning, or afternoon perhaps. To Hazel, she believed that was the best sleep she had in a while, thinking it was only 7:30AM.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning sweetie,&rdquo; her mother called. Usually, her mother never came into her room on school mornings. It was a surprise to say the least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning mum,&rdquo; Hazel replied grumpily as she got dressed in her school uniform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing? I already called in sick for you,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s already 2PM,&rdquo; Hazel grabbed her phone and indeed did it display 2PM, realising she had slept through her alarm and basically the whole school day. &ldquo;Sweetie, I know you&#39;re sad&hellip;Why don&#39;t we go out for dinner tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel smiled a little and slipped back into bed, watching videos on her phone until it was time to go to the restaurant. Of course they went to her favourite restaurant, a Korean place. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get me a kimchi fried rice, for my sake alright Hazel?&rdquo; a voice asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Hazel smiled. &ldquo;Wait what?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hmm?&rdquo; her father asked. &ldquo;What&#39;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you say you wanted kimchi fried rice?&rdquo; Hazel asked back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? No, I&#39;m sharing the bulgogi with your mother,&rdquo; he replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh. Must be hearing things then,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The days following the restaurant incident blurred together. Hazel found herself constantly second-guessing what she heard, wondering if grief was playing tricks on her mind. She&#39;d catch herself setting two plates at dinner, or pausing mid-conversation as if waiting for someone to respond. Her parents exchanged worried glances more frequently, whispering in hushed tones when they thought she wasn&#39;t listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At school, she moved through the corridors like a ghost herself. Classmates offered their condolences, but their words felt hollow. Ryan avoided her completely, ignoring and moving on with her. He didn&#39;t want to disturb her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The funeral was held days after. Hazel sat in the front row, mourning his death tragically. Tears shed and whimpers of pain were let out. It was disgraceful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Calm down!&rdquo; the voices soothed, gently massaging her fluctuating panic. Of course, Hazel thought nothing of this and believed it was her own mind saying these commands. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel, are you alright? It looks like you&#39;ve just seen a ghost,&rdquo; her mother warned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m fine&hellip;It&#39;s just&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s hard to digest? I understand,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no. I can hear his voice still calling me somewhere!&rdquo; Hazel whined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;ll get you to a psychologist. It will help you get over it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As if it is going to help,&rdquo; Hazel scoffed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How would you know that?&rdquo; her mother asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I just&hellip;I just do&hellip;&rdquo; Her mind cut blank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was clear to Hazel that the voice&rsquo;s interventions became more frequent. It whispered &quot;Breathe, Hazel&quot; during panic attacks in the grocery aisle, a phantom pressure on her shoulder when she felt like collapsing. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her mother&rsquo;s suggestion of a psychologist felt less like help and more like a sentence, an admission that the fragile connection she felt to Jun was just broken wiring in her brain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Hoon, you have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.&rdquo; the nurse explained, holding a sinking tone. &ldquo;Your levels are only mild and for now, no medication is needed,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a shock to even be diagnosed like this. It would change her life. That night, nothing added up. The voice felt too real, yet so fake at the same time. She knew that ghosts were not real and that it must&#39;ve been the tragedy that shaped this hallucination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Hazel laid back down into bed immersed in the dark and silent room, she felt a warm sensation gripping onto her hip. No, it wasn&#39;t just another vision of hers, it felt so real. Then, a radiating body of warmth pressed onto her back. She snuggled happily, a slow grin forming on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then she jolted back. Was someone in her bed? Frantically, she turned the bedside lamp on. But nothing was there. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright?&rdquo; the voice echoed again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Hazel wailed, immediately bursting into tears. &ldquo;Just end me, please! I don&#39;t want this fear to linger anymore in me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about Hazel? It&#39;s me&hellip;There&#39;s nothing to cry about,&rdquo; the voice calmed. Hazel looked towards the wall littered with posters. Then a faint neon blue outline faded into her vision. &ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just us. Only you can see me and interact with me&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;it can&#39;t be&hellip;!&rdquo; Hazel cried, sniffing. Hazel fell forwards towards the ghost, landing in its arms gently. Its hands wrapped around Hazel&#39;s swiftly, comforting her like he had always done. &ldquo;Is it really you&hellip;Jun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was a question that could be answered without words, the same feeling, the same sensation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, it&#39;s me Hazel. Rather, it&#39;s my soul. Now that it&#39;s been almost a month since the incident, I understand how my soul is still alive,&rdquo; Jun explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Hazel whispered, loosening her grip on Jun. She turned off the lights and slid back into bed. &ldquo;I want to hear more of your story. I&#39;ll always love you, even if you&#39;re a wandering soul&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I never told anyone about the experiment. Ryan and I during physics were doing mineral conductivity and we chose Orichalcum&hellip;What we didn&#39;t know was that the Orichalcum was actually impure and had clumps of cosmic energy&hellip;After I died, I saw my body violently thrown to the ground and my soul stood there, flickering. That&#39;s when I realised I needed a host, so I chose you.&rdquo; Jun clarified. Hazel cuddled tightly in Jun&#39;s arms as his voice calmed her down, like a soothing lullaby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it like to be a soul then?&rdquo; Hazel asked quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I can fly and teleport back to you. That makes you able to fly as well since you can hold onto me. I do have a range of 50 metres so I can&#39;t stray too far away from you,&rdquo; Jun began. &ldquo;Obviously I can&#39;t touch anything, I phase through any physical body. I actually don&#39;t know much else&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah, really? You reckon we can go for a fly sometime?&rdquo; Hazel suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You bet! If that helps make you happy, sure,&rdquo; Jun smiled. Hazel saw Jun smile, his spirit-like body grinning. Though almost a ghost, Hazel didn&#39;t mind. It was him and he was by her side, forever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you so much Jun,&rdquo; Hazel whispered, cuddling tighter against his body. Jun leant down and kissed her, the warming feeling filling her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As morning came around, Hazel felt revitalised. It was nearing the end of the school year so their exams had begun. Hazel devised a new way of communicating with Jun, now typing messages on her phone to show to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me the answers for every question of the&hellip;exam. Hazel&hellip;you cheeky girl! Stop cheating!&rdquo; Jun giggled. Hazel quietly blushed, hiding it behind her innocent smile. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was no sign of guilt coming from her. It was a pure invitation, request perhaps, for Jun to satisfy. Hazel usually was one of the brighter students, but having experienced a tragedy, she hadn&#39;t studied much over the past month. It only felt right for Jun to help her through her academic struggle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow! Well done Hazel,&rdquo; the teacher congratulated days after. &ldquo;You must&#39;ve let go well and plowed through your studies! 98%!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The exam paper drifted onto her desk and a bold A+ was streaked across the front page. A faint smile lit up on her face. It was small actions like this that made Hazel feel happy, but most importantly, safe. She knew she could count on Jun to help her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Across the days they spent, the two would go for evening flights to highpoints to watch the sunset, and romantic nights cuddled up in her room watching movies on her monitor. It was pure joy for Hazel and she cherished every moment of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But everyday well spent felt like a step in the wrong direction. Something felt off in Singapore. There was more than just a mystic aura that surrounded the inner city. It felt haunting, and this ominous apprehension only increased when Jun formed as a ghost. Was there a much more sinister force within the city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was about 5 years prior, when Hazel and Jun were both young and vigorous, enjoying their early childhood. Cramped in a lackluster and vintage apartment was a fresh graduate out of the country&rsquo;s national university, Paige Pastel, an aspiring author.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s works derived from her Arts degree, attempting to create authentic and unconventional works. She wrote meticulously, day and night. But something just didn&#39;t click with her. Every story, every idea never sold, her narratives laying to waste in her fantasy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To Paige, writing was a form of love, she felt closely connected to it. Her desire to create a viral sensation of a novel had always churned deep within her heart, it was just needing to be heard. Something just had to jump off the page that hooked readers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When desperate times called, Paige looked towards marketing strategists, but even those campaigns would sell low volume, with critical reviews that brought Paige even further down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Monsters&hellip;Monsters!&rdquo; Paige cackled, ripping the pages of her notebook. Her actions were frivolous, frantically seeking that of desperation where hope could once again sink itself into her mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then there was the buzz. The phone was vibrating ecstatically. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s this?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello Paige, my name is Barton Colerico from Anateros.&rdquo; Barton mumbled. &ldquo;I really liked your book&hellip;your creativity intrigues me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go on&hellip;?&rdquo; Paige began. The line ended abruptly, with a new message incoming that detailed the location. The message read &ldquo;Tomorrow at noon&rdquo;, with an address attached. Paige questioned the credibility of the man, debating whether it was a special contract or some guidance. Nevertheless, Paige knew that she had to take the risk as it could lead her to new opportunities to show her passion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Paige stepped into the facility guarded with tall, electric fences, the man calmly approached her. His expression was monotone, his movements robotic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Pastel, Colerico is waiting for you. Let me show you the way,&rdquo; the man offered, welcoming Paige to one of the headquarters Anateros had. The facility was complex internally, with walls painted in white, emphasising the more scientific vibe rather than a creative or media agency that would work with Paige.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ms Pastel I presume?&rdquo; the figure asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you&hellip;Barton Colerico?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;Yes&hellip;Let me have a moment please,&rdquo; Barton suggested, motioning for the worker to move away. &ldquo;Now then, you say you want to become noticed for your dedication? I can do that for you. Do you have what it takes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s eyes lit up as she heard the voice of reinforcement, praising her talent. She was another step closer to achieving her dream. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The white room sung like a void as she stepped into the muffled headspace, feeling as if she was sinking into an ultra soft mattress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Colerico, will this really work?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are one of the very few subjects that have been selected. Trust me, you won&#39;t feel a thing.&rdquo; Barton reassured, leaning against the lever. Slowly, a hatch revealed a small concentrate of pure orichalcum, reflecting the speckles of light down into the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An ethereal glow almost burning as bright as a vibrant orange erupted, followed by a patch of black smoke that diffused under Paige&#39;s breath. The unexpected explosion didn&#39;t appear to harm or hurt her in any way, and was gladly surprised. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well? Do you feel any different?&rdquo; Barton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing. Is this a scam?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, no, there must be something wrong! I&#39;m certain it worked!&rdquo; Barton begged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you praised my work, I won&#39;t say anything. Goodbye,&rdquo; Paige declared, storming off. She felt somewhat disappointed, and also a flicker of hope that resurged under the panic of escaping love. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though Paige had a new sensation of success now ingrained to her, she still couldn&#39;t shake the overwhelmingly critical view of her works. Statistics still didn&#39;t change, even though Barton had promised. For Paige, it was an uncertain feeling of hope and believed that she went to such drastic measures for nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, bored out of her mind in her apartment, she took her pen out from her coat pocket and began sketching ideas. As each stroke brushed the surface of the notebook, strange vibrations played beneath the pages, a violent pull tugging on the pages. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What Paige had sketched was a terrifying beast with a head of a dragon, the body of a lion with wings of a falcon. To her surprise, her sketches came to life. Now transformed from the ordinary static ink to more of a vintage styled animation, she realised that Barton&#39;s scheme perhaps wasn&#39;t a fluke. It gave her innovation, so she began writing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her novels became more of a graphic novel with more and more of her pocket sized animated graphics printed on paper, where audiences were stunned to see the moving characters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, Paige found her books selling, but it wasn&#39;t for her writing. It was for the visuals, the new innovative images that nobody could get their heads around. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you hear about the new book by Paige Pastel?&rdquo; Jun asked as Hazel studied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No? Who&#39;s that?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Word says, she has a really unique style of art that allows for static visuals to move&hellip;&rdquo; Jun explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really? I might have to go to the bookstore then&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel replied, closing her laptop. The day was clear so Hazel decided to go to the mall, to satisfy Jun&#39;s wish to read Paige Pastel&#39;s book. In fact, Hazel also took upon the curiosity in Paige&#39;s book. Jun&#39;s explanation, how could static visuals move on a piece of paper?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bookstore was eerily grim somehow, almost no customers inside. It was decorated nicely, with the front shelf displaying Paige&#39;s books.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s see,&rdquo; Hazel began, flipping through the pages. As each page breathed in the light, they moved along the thin sheet of paper, crawling against the edges. &ldquo;Woah!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The rumors were indeed true and the images moved, so Hazel watched eagerly. The boy twirled his pencil around on the page, toying around with the words that were printed beside him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel! Those images&hellip;they have some cosmic energy&hellip;I can feel it! It feels sinister in a sense&hellip;.Hazel we have to go!&rdquo; Jun exclaimed. &ldquo;There&#39;s something terribly wrong!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Just as Hazel tried to close the book, the boy picked up a phone from another page, dialling a number. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jun exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up, ghost!&rdquo; the boy yelled, his voice echoing throughout the store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ghost?&rdquo; customers asked, directing their attention towards Hazel. &ldquo;Ma&#39;am, are you alright?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah, I&#39;m fine,&rdquo; Hazel replied embarrassingly, hiding the book back onto the shelf. But it was too late. The phone call had been made. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel! The boy, he called someone! We might be in deep trouble&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Jun exclaimed. Hazel flipped the page.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Us sketches can do anything within our paper dimension. It&#39;s completely 3D! As long as we are exposed to light we can move, talk and appear 2D whenever we want,&rdquo; another character explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s heart skipped a beat. There were some new sounds, a trail of foodsteps that rang in the back of her ears. A grim lady walked in with pink headphones on, ignoring the chatter amongst the customers. She directed herself towards Hazel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Move!&rdquo; Jun ordered, the two quickly bolting out of the store. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So the ghost kissed her neck right?&rdquo; the boy in the book began. Paige listened carefully on her phone, paying attention to the minute details he gave. &ldquo;That&#39;s what you&#39;re missing out on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A ghost? Someone that is dead&hellip;still loves her?&rdquo; Paige spat. &ldquo;People appreciate my work&hellip;But it isn&#39;t for my writing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her tantrum forced her out, but Paige knew what to do. Hazel&#39;s cosmic energy perhaps was the best option, her powers holding the potential to fulfil the prolonged infatuation of innovation Paige had desired. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is her power? Is it&hellip;like mine?&rdquo; Paige asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It appears it might be a ghost&hellip;&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;That&#39;s all,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! I know! I will be able to spy on great writers and copy their habits&hellip;&rdquo; Paige snarled. &ldquo;Once she is mine, she&#39;ll love me for the amazing literacy I craft! with her power!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige couldn&#39;t hold back her tears, weeping in joy outside the mall. She wiped her tears and drew a mouse. &ldquo;Go! Go! Find me Hazel Hoon, and I will capture her alive&hellip;No one will escape my prison!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soon, the mouse latched onto its target, contacting Paige immediately. She rushed to the abandoned rooftop garden where Hazel was presumed to be, ready to fight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel Hoon,&rdquo; Paige&#39;s voice sang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And who are you invading my privacy? How did you get up here?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The stairs,&rdquo; Paige scoffed, pointing towards the folded paper stairway she had created. The folds were sharp, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you&hellip;!&rdquo; Hazel gasped. Paige laughed and sketched a blade, a katana appearing in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Paige&#39;s paper katana swiftly gushed thousands of paper cuts on Hazel&#39;s body, creating tiny streams of blood that trickled all over her. Hazel limped, her body growing weaker. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;bastard&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel groaned. She stepped forward, pushing herself. Jun stood focused, giving her more energy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pathetic!&rdquo; Paige snickered, her paper katana now shifting into a chain. &ldquo;I&#39;ve now folded my creations&hellip;You cannot rip it apart!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The chain wrapped tight around Hazel&#39;s neck, strangling her. Hazel gasped for air, but her grip on the chain loosened. She felt her body giving in. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stupid girl&hellip;&rdquo; Jun muttered, disappointed. Hazel was almost dead, her body weak. The redness around her neck was becoming more apparent, and there seemed to be nothing she could do. As Jun began his takeover of Hazel&#39;s body for his last act, he gave it his all, concentrating all his energy. It was his time. His body, temporarily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Swiftly, Hazel&#39;s hands snatched Paige&#39;s pen that was lodged in her pocket to scribble some scissors, cutting the chain loose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How could you&hellip;? That&#39;s MY pen!&rdquo; Paige yelled, lunging towards Hazel. Jun reacted quickly, drawing a wall making Paige run into it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This will be your own undoing,&rdquo; Hazel muttered, beginning to draw a portal. &ldquo;Live in your imagination! You&#39;ll never be anything,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The portal radiated a dim white, shades of gray begging her to come. The grainy ink hands pulled against the ripples of the portal, sucking Paige into the abyss. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My&hellip;own creation&hellip;? Where am I going?&rdquo; Paige screamed. &ldquo;It can&#39;t be! Trapped in my paper dimension!!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;It&#39;s called&hellip;innovation&hellip;&rdquo; Jun muttered, grinning. &ldquo;To be honest, I actually liked you as an author&hellip;I&#39;ve read your book &lsquo;</span><span class="c4">27 Reasons Why</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;. Such a shame&hellip;Paige&hellip;Pastel&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;read my book?&rdquo; Paige gasped as her body seeped into the portal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you said in that book, life is simple&hellip;love isn&#39;t a prize&rdquo; Jun laughed weakly, spitting out blood from Hazel&#39;s mouth. &ldquo;I love how you contradict your own writing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun quickly snapped the pen, breaking it with the cosmic energy erupting from the vial. Ink splattered everywhere and the energy soared back into the skies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Using his last breath, Jun finally ripped the portal up, prohibiting Paige from returning. Her power was truly horrifying, being able to manifest her sketches into paper objects. Jun was terribly weakened, his energy all drained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s body then instantly froze, slowly toppling forward with a loud thud. Jun&#39;s energy was dissipated, and Hazel was already out from previously. The cuts began to bleed again and she laid there on the floor, unconscious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Both girls brutally fought with fatal injuries. One trapped in an eternal prison created by her own love, while Jun was trapped in an eternal prison created by Hazel&#39;s love.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quiet hospital room lingered with uncertainty. Hazel slept peacefully, still hurt from the aftermath. Her eyes blinked at the sound of the machinery that surrounded the bed, slowly coming to her senses. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun emerged from her now conscious body, clinging onto her tightly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank god&hellip;You&#39;re alright,&rdquo; Jun sighed. A tear fell from Hazel&#39;s eyes, then carefully wrapped her arms around him. She was careful that no one was around, as it would be awkward. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel Hoon,&rdquo; the voice called. The curtain was pulled, then a fresh face appeared behind. &ldquo;You must be the spirit that has been appearing in my dreams&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&hellip;see me?&rdquo; Jun asked. The man placed a hand on his ghost, clearly showing that he could also see him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Elias Novem. If you two would want, I can get you contracts under the International Supernatural Intelligence Division as a force. We&#39;re in constant need of allies as more cosmic disparities take place among Earth,&rdquo; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&#39;s more like us?&rdquo; Hazel asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, nothing like you. What has happened to you is Jun has conjured his soul into your body and your love is able to manifest him as what you see him as,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;Our other units all have unique abilities, similar but not the same to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do remember, the more you enchant yourself, I do have to recharge within your body. My powers aren&#39;t unlimited.&rdquo; Jun explained, kissing her neck. Hazel giggled as she laid back down. Elias had left already to respect their privacy, leaving a contact card on the table beside her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, there were knocks at the door. It was her family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel? Are you alright?&rdquo; her mother cried. She wept out in tears and she hugged her daughter, relieved she was fine. &ldquo;I had thought you died!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her father chuckled as he grinned happily, seeing the change in mood of her daughter. &ldquo;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re safe and all better,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel joined in on the happiness, comforting her parents, realising the consequences she had to bear with. Her parents threw them off casually, something they wouldn&#39;t normally do and instead blamed themselves. But Hazel knew that was out of their control. It was solely her own fault. But then, Hazel had realised her journey. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t just about reconnecting with Jun&#39;s ghost, nor about winning and beating that scumbag of a doofus into a pulp. For a moment, Hazel cleared her mind, ready to move forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel was glad that her family was here. Hazel had finally understood what it meant to love someone. She understood that people could still live internally even after their physical death, supporting, protecting, guiding and enchanting one to success.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.2bq4xdcrn7sp"><span class="c3">&nbsp;II - A Controlling Confession</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The morning dew drew cold gazes from the neighbouring birds that perched upon the old Tembusu tree. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Drip, drop. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel closed her eyes, sitting on the bench in the school yard. The watchful eye gazed upon her, secretly afar. Not a sound was made, all that Hazel could hear was the chilling hums of nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The chirps muffled the menacing sensation that was placed onto Hazel as the target lingered upon her body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel,&rdquo; Jun whispered, stroking her hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel tilted her head back, grinning. &ldquo;Hmmm?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we going to do now?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Live our lives as normal&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re graduating really soon&hellip;Yet you haven&#39;t decided on anything&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Hazel scoffed. &ldquo;You&#39;re one to say. I learnt a lot after our fight with that bitch Paige that passion can be blinding,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&#39;s an exception!&rdquo; Jun replied. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel rolled her eyes, annoyed. &ldquo;Can you stay away today? I need to study for the test.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun sighed, nodding to her request and hiding away back in her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good, stay in there,&rdquo; Hazel muttered, opening her phone. As she walked towards the Art Block, Hazel noticed a student waiting for her, at the building&#39;s door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re Hazel Hoon, right?&rdquo; the boy asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, who are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, uh, I&#39;m really sorry about your loss and recent incidents, you just seem really quiet and sad and I was wondering if you were okay,&rdquo; the boy smiled awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel gave him a blank gaze, then chuckled. &ldquo;I&#39;m alright,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re in the same design class so if you need help, you can tell me. My name is Liam by the way.&rdquo; Liam replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel kept her smile as Liam held the door, going into class with a strange sensation. Jun stood quiet within Hazel&#39;s heart, his spirit residing peacefully, attempting to not disturb Hazel&#39;s academic progress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel didn&#39;t remember Liam being in her class but at first sight, Liam spoke words to her. Something only Jun had done before to her someone else did. She didn&#39;t question Liam&#39;s history or how he got there, she was intrigued by his identity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His blueberry eyes spoke of gallantry, his chestnut hair radiated charm. There was nothing to not like about Liam, his handsome physique said it all. Not only was it his outer shell, his mannerisms were well-spoken as well, his actions all taken with logic and thought. Just like the new kid Hazel believed he was, he did everything flawlessly and beautifully, every aspect aligning in her vision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel,&rdquo; the teacher snapped. &ldquo;Are you with us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Hazel jolted back into reality, her senses settling. &ldquo;I&#39;m sorry, may I use the bathroom?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The teacher sighed, and let Hazel wander down the empty hallway. She glared at the notice board, hanging on the gloomy wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Promotional posters for clubs were pinned against the monotone abomination, the words &ldquo;Theatre Club&rdquo; jumped out of the flyer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&#39;t know who&#39;s under the mask!&rdquo; was the quote in serif letters beneath the name, decorated with opera masks. Then, footsteps grew louder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel?&rdquo; her teacher asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y..Yes Mr Lee?&rdquo; Hazel stuttered, surprised he had come out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know it has been hard for you lately, but I think what you have been doing, isolating yourself isn&#39;t the right move,&rdquo; Mr Lee explained. Hazel was confused on why Mr Lee was mentioning this, especially at this time. She had friends apart from Jun who were there for her. &ldquo;Perhaps you could socialise with Liam, the new boy. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s kind, and I find him as a quite charming young man,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you telling me this?&rdquo; said Hazel with a disgusted expression. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel like you&hellip;uh&hellip;just need some help,&rdquo; Mr Lee expressed. As Hazel walked back to the classroom, she witnessed Mr Lee&#39;s movements feel robotic in a way, as if something was controlling him. Hazel threw it off as a figment of her imagination, thinking little of these things. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel knew deep inside that she had to talk with Liam. There was just an uneasy gap between the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After class, Liam surprisingly approached Hazel again, and Hazel was again, slightly embarrassed. She grinned awkwardly as she listened to Liam talk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you show me around the school?&rdquo; He asked politely. Of course, Hazel agreed without giving it too much thought, thinking any time would be better than no time around others. She had found being next to people made her feel more comfortable as there were actually people who were willing to help her, though she wasn&#39;t the one actively pursuing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So this is what this school is like?&rdquo; Liam asked as he chewed on the mundane cafeteria lunch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, this is the average high school experience in Singapore,&rdquo; Hazel replied, lost in his sight. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You seem like a cool guy tho,&rdquo; Hazel added sheepishly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You too, I really like your personality!&rdquo; Liam replied, laughing a bit. Hazel blushed cherry red, trying to cover her embarrassment. Hazel sighed deeply, regaining her composure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few more classes, the school day neared the end. As Hazel passed the notice board again, he saw Liam staring at one of the posters. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Hazel asked curiously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m thinking of joining the theatre club,&rdquo; Liam explained. &ldquo;I quite enjoy acting actually, I took lessons when I was young,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That sounds nice,&rdquo; Hazel replied, smiling. &ldquo;Say, see you tomorrow?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, you too!&rdquo; Liam replied as Hazel walked off. Hazel held her head high as she passed the Tembusu tree near the gate. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following days after Hazel&#39;s initial greeting with Liam surprisingly went well, with the two spending more time in art class collaborating and communicating. The two developed a close friendship quickly, and Hazel didn&#39;t know what to say about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Deep inside and back home, Jun had raised warnings to Hazel about Liam being suspicious, but Hazel didn&#39;t care too much. Hazel believed that Jun was just jealous how she had made a new male friend that quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So do you have any hobbies?&rdquo; Hazel asked during lunch on a regular school day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been into tattoos and stuff lately,&rdquo; Liam replied, grinning ear to ear. &ldquo;I&#39;ve taught myself how to do tattoo art with a permanent marker at the moment,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Hazel laughed, curious about his technique. &ldquo;Say, you do one for me?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She twirled her hair as she smiled back at Liam. Liam smirked. &ldquo;Yeah, follow me after school,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After school, Hazel followed Liam home to see what his art skills were all about. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey uh, just saying, I&#39;m not the best, I can only do this flower if that&#39;s alright,&rdquo; said Liam awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s alright,&rdquo; Hazel replied. In reality, Liam had no idea what he was doing. All he wanted to do was to place his &lsquo;mark&rsquo; on Hazel. It was the start of something more sinister, but it was the only way forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After half an hour of elegant line work, Liam had completed his artwork on Hazel&#39;s right shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow! That looks beautiful! I love it!&rdquo; Hazel exclaimed as she glanced in the mirror. The rose had elegant curves and the use of various width markers gave it depth, making it feel like a real tattoo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The following days felt warm and soft with Hazel tracing the petals of her tattoo during class. She&#39;d catch herself staring at the intricate linework on her arm every so often, hiding it away from her parents. It felt like something significant, as if an angel had blessed her. She didn&#39;t dare wash it off, it felt like something precious, something valuable that she would cherish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel didn&#39;t think much of the tattoo at first, but it became evident that it was truly unique as she began to feel a warming sensation throbbing inside her body with the tattoo being the source. The rose tattoo felt alive, with its thorns pointing outwards violently as if it was from a gothic rock band.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not buying it,&rdquo; Jun said quietly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! You know nothing&hellip;it feels special&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel frowned as she curled up in bed. Jun&#39;s hands wrapped gently around Hazel, comforting her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It feels&hellip;suspicious,&rdquo; Jun claimed, now moving his hands down against her hips. Hazel smiled, nudging Jun against his side. She felt the fingers caress her curves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Days passed, and Liam only grew closer to Hazel, Jun now barely able to spend time with Hazel. It seemed as if Hazel spent most of her time talking and sharing memories with Liam. Part of Jun was happy to see her move out of her comfort zone and gain the ability to move on, but there was a hollow hole left in </span><span>Jun</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that made him question if Hazel was doing the right thing. He felt such an evil sensation only growing closer to Hazel, but couldn&#39;t pick out what it exactly was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was one quiet afternoon after school when Hazel had finally had some free time away from Liam. She wanted to check in on Jun for not talking with him for a while. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even late at night when Jun could be with her, he chose not to. Jun believed letting the relationship play out would be the best chain of events to see where everything was truly going. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He did secretly come out sometimes at midnight, unable to resist the urge to hold Hazel tightly afraid of any danger that would abruptly attack her. There was something sinister lurking beyond the surface.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel had wandered to the school roof, an area that not many students knew how to get to. It was already 5pm and most students were gone, but Hazel had stayed to enjoy the sunset, hoping to get some time with Jun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the door clicked. The entrance rattled for ages while Hazel tried to piece together who it was. Normally, all students would&#39;ve gone home by now, but the only person Hazel could think of to come here was Liam, even though she had told him explicitly to let her be alone for the afternoon for once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jun&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel whispered. No reply. Where had he gone? &ldquo;Jun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s Jun?&rdquo; Liam asked rudely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh um&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel stuttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Actually, I don&#39;t need to know. I </span><span class="c4">already</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;know. It&#39;s your boyfriend, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo; Liam snickered. His voice grew dark, his pace quickened. &ldquo;Too bad you couldn&#39;t see through my guise,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hazel panicked. Liam&#39;s body began to float and Hazel&#39;s heart sank into the abyssal void Jun had drowned in, unable to move. She was paralyzed in fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Liam&#39;s face ripped into a lustrous and petite young girl, her hair flowing like the river caressed in crimson stripes. Her beauty slashed the exterior masculine body, revealing her ultimate form.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;ve caused enough trouble in our universe&hellip;I can feel it tearing! For the Lord of Wisdom, Lucina rises!&rdquo; Lucina yelled. Hazel tried to scramble, but the tattoo she had gotten jolted her body back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t move!&rdquo; Hazel squealed, squirming with all her might. Her body felt like it was controlled like a puppet, a force tugging her legs backward. &ldquo;I&#39;m being controlled!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! Stay still!&rdquo; Lucina ordered, forcing Hazel to slap herself on the face. Hazel gazed at the tattoo again, only to realise it wasn&#39;t a tattoo. It was a mark, a symbol of control. She was the puppet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you going to do with me?&rdquo; Hazel begged, her eyes tearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I want to hear your shrill voice, piercing that of the silence!&rdquo; Lucina laughed. &ldquo;I want to hear that squeal, that scream, that moan of terror!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mmph!&rdquo; Hazel grunted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are breaking the Jespan&#39;s dream apart&hellip;If you live, the universe collapses&hellip;Your ghost of a boyfriend has caused this cosmic disparity!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s hands gripped onto her own soft neck, her fingers pressing hard on her smooth skin. She whimpered weakly as she struggled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Hazel choked, her vision getting thinner. Lucina pushed Hazel against the wall, feeling her pulsing heartbeat. Hazel felt her body skip a beat, sinking into something warm. Lucina grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina thrusted her fist towards Hazel, but to her surprise Hazel counterattacked by attempting to throw a kick. Lucina dodged easily, pushing Hazel back down again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;P&hellip;Please&hellip;S&hellip;Stop&hellip;&rdquo; Hazel gurgled. White foam frothed from her mouth, now on the brink of death.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile the battle was raging outside, the tattoo&#39;s marks had infested the interior of Hazel&#39;s soul, plaguing every last patch with the poisonous thorns.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun wandered carefully, attempting to pluck away the sharp, veiny roots the rose had implanted in her body. His pale hands brushed the rigid green stems, trying to move among the thick labyrinth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">These roots had been growing ever since the mark had been implanted on Hazel, and Jun struggled to come out. The physical mark had left a permanent scar both physically and mentally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">They wouldn&#39;t budge, especially to those ghostly hands Jun had. He couldn&#39;t interact or do anything to save Hazel. But he believed. As Hazel struggled, the roots crawled further back, slowly retracting as life faded out of her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Goodbye. It was fun while it lasted,&rdquo; Lucina scoffed, smiling as she turned her back on Hazel&#39;s dead body. It had flopped to the ground like an askew statue. Her body reeked a faint glow, frozen, but still somehow alive. Lucina ignored it, believing she was already dead. The mark faded away and Jun was free again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel&hellip;This is my remaining power! Let your body be my host for one last dance!&rdquo; Jun erupted, his voice reaching Lucina. Hazel&#39;s eyes began glowing a shimmering golden yellow, her body floating in the hair as if she was being crucified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;More ghostly magic?&rdquo; Lucina spat, twitching at the sight of her power carrying on even after her death. &ldquo;How will I remove you now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina concentrated a dense ball of energy, flinging it towards Hazel. It hit her chest hard, leaving another mark. The flower&#39;s roots rushed into her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Hazel&#39;s body streaked forward, plunging directly towards Lucina like a bullet. Lucina&#39;s expression widened at the speed at which Hazel&#39;s body flew over, knocking her hard into the building&#39;s wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Lucina grumbled, crawling out under the crumbled debris of the wall. Hazel&#39;s body rose through the mess and was covered in blood, but still looked menacingly stronger than before. Lucina gasped in shock for the first time in many centuries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun, now in somewhat control of Hazel&#39;s body again lunged towards Lucina, aiming to wound her severely. Hazel&#39;s fist was concentrated with energy, love pulsing every beat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wha-at? No-o-o! This can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Lucina squelched. Blood spattered forward, her logic muddled. Jun had torn a deep, hollow hole in Lucina&#39;s body, rendering her almost dead immediately. She attempted to control Hazel&#39;s body again, but it was no use. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know your weakness. You can only control living organisms with that mark of yours&hellip;Sucks to say I can possess anything since I&#39;m a ghost manifested from love!&rdquo; Jun snickered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jun&#39;s fist tore out of Lucina&#39;s wound, completely free of her control. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina motioned for aid, unable to regain full control of Hazel&#39;s body. It was in possession of love itself, it was in possession of Jun. &ldquo;As her life fades away, I will join her. That is what love is&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The faded white silhouette of Jun masked the geometric shapes that blurred Lucina&#39;s vision, seeing her last moments as a Jespan Lord. How could she, of all, be defeated by mere humans? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina wept as a hollow, donut wound ate her body. She bled out slowly, laying hopeless on the roof. The clouds fluffed up as she gazed up, only to see formations of those she battled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A pool of venom green blood was splattered against the concrete floor, emitting a foul stench that dissipated in the air. Lucina tried to crawl with her last breath, hoping her allies would assist her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hazel&#39;s body toppled over, landing beside Lucina. There was silence for a moment before the breathless sound of sprinting was heard coming from the stairs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For Hazel and Jun, all they could see was their love. Bound by something extraordinary named the power of love burned Lucina&#39;s preliminary notion of wisdom and knowledge, savouring her death for the shimmering sunset.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I can&#39;t die like this&hellip;&rdquo; Lucina gasped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Die like what?&rdquo; a voice emerged, tired and huffing. The black vests adorned with magenta streaks of the officials of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division appeared, with the notorious face of their leader leaning down towards her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sucks to be a Jespan Lord, heh?&rdquo; Elias chuckled, floating down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;you! It can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Lucina gasped. Over the following days, Lucina died with her body being cremated, attempting to restore some cosmic balance. The ISID had presumed this technique would greatly help, patching any cosmic disparities that may have laid around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina&#39;s body drifted away along with the breeze, the ash scattering among the ground like autumn leaves. There was flow back into the world, but Elias knew that this was the beginning of something far more dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Jespan Lords had begun their pursuit. He didn&#39;t know much, but all Elias could think of then was about Hazel. She had sacrificed her life to take down one of the most powerful supernatural beings alive.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.i04j9mnxwx07"><span class="c3">III - As the Void Gently Weeps</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good afternoon Singapore, we bring to you the latest news. The International Supernatural Intelligence Division is currently investigating a series of electromagnetic anomalies. We urge the public to stay safe as these are complex cases that deserve careful, scientific inquiry.&rdquo; the TV blared. The waiting room was quiet and Milo said patiently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo Trueno,&rdquo; the receptionist called. Milo entered the room, not expecting much. The intimidating sign; International Supernatural Intelligence Division loomed above the counter as he approached the friendly woman who sat idly at the desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi?&rdquo; Milo greeted awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here for the test funding I presume?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. How much am I getting paid?&rdquo; Milo asked nervously, crossing his fingers behind his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;$1,000. If the tests go well, you could work here,&rdquo; the receptionist reassured. &ldquo;Third room on your left,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo walked down the hallway to the room the receptionist had asked him to go to. As he pressed upon the large blue doors with the label &ldquo;Testing Chamber&rdquo;, butterflies flooded his stomach. He had never felt this much pressure, but it meant that he could finally live a proper life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo Trueno I presume?&rdquo; the doctor asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, here for testing,&rdquo; Milo replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, my name is Dr. Lim, I just need you to hold this crystal,&rdquo; Dr Lim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Milo asked curiously, his fingers tracing the flat edges of the crystal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an orichalcum crystal. It&rsquo;s supposed to be an abundant mountain mineral, but they happen to conduct cosmic energy extremely well, awakening secret powers within the universe,&rdquo; Dr. Lim explained. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t hurt a bit, but it will feel ticklish,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Lim approached the silver button mounted on the wall, activating the mechanism that directed cosmic energy into the crystal. &ldquo;Stay VERY still!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he pressed the button, a short, faint purple wave traversed the room, locating the crystal to which it transferred into. As the crystal became the new host of the cosmic energy, Dr. Lim moved to a different room beside Milo, ready to execute the final step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you see that plate? Place the orichalcum on it and press the red button,&rdquo; Dr. Lim instructed. Milo followed his instructions and a strong, deafening force engulfed the room, knocking Milo over onto the soft padded floors. The room was designed extremely well for human testing and Milo didn&rsquo;t get injured, only confused and a bit sleepy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Dr. Lim quickly rushed back into the room, comforting Milo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright? Did it work?&rdquo; Dr. Lim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;&rdquo; Milo replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, the testing normally only succeeds 7% of the time. Let me know if you find anything soon. It can take up to 24 hours for abilities to form within the human body,&rdquo; Dr. Lim smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be successful. Patience is a virtue afterall,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo walked out back to the receptionist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did everything go?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I don&rsquo;t know-&rdquo; Milo began. However, his words cut short. His body sparked and leapt into the computer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah!&rdquo; the receptionist smiled. She picked up the phone and dialled in her supervisor. &ldquo;Director Ozim, I think we got a new agent!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The meeting room was vibrant, in fact lively as Milo would describe. Milo had found his new abilities and was eager to finally make some money. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, Milo Trueno, what should I call you? You&rsquo;ve got supernatural abilities, so it&rsquo;s normal to have a code name,&rdquo; Ozim asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Code name? Like a superhero?&rdquo; Milo asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, exactly. I&rsquo;ve seen your power as my employee has described,&rdquo; Ozim began. &ldquo;Conducting and insulating electricity&hellip;Turning into living electricity&hellip;Frightening&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How about Malstrom?&rdquo; Milo suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim snapped his fingers. &ldquo;Yes! That sounds slick, suitable for you. Also, you said you are having financial difficulties, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo nodded in eagerness. &ldquo;Yes, my parents both have stage 4 cancer&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to lose them&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry. I&rsquo;ll give you a job, if you can complete it, I&rsquo;ll wire you anything you need. Whether it be money, I&rsquo;ll make sure your life is turned around,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you so much sir&hellip;&rdquo; Milo gasped, his heart racing. For once, he was finally able to make a name for himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, here&rsquo;s your job rundown,&rdquo; Ozim began. He pulled out his phone and showed a headline: &ldquo;Sudden Radiation Surge at Train Station Hospitalises Seven&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He zoomed in on the CCTV footage embedded in the article. Star was in the background walking past a steel pole, eyes low.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Three of those people developed aggressive tumours a week later. The others are blind now,&rdquo; Ozim said grimly. &ldquo;We traced the radiation burst. It wasn&rsquo;t from any machine. It came from someone&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not possible&hellip;&rdquo; Milo murmured. &ldquo;Radiation can&rsquo;t just come from a human.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unless that human was made into something else,&rdquo; Ozim replied, voice cold. &ldquo;Look through this gallery, every unexplained EM anomaly in the last month, every spike in gamma signatures, Star was there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s just a nerd from my English class,&rdquo; Milo protested weakly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s quiet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even </span><span class="c4">realise</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;what he is,&rdquo; Ozim said. &ldquo;That&#39;s what makes him dangerous. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing. But people keep dying around him. And no one will believe it until it&#39;s too late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Wait, are you suggesting the cancer my parents mysteriously got could be by </span><span class="c4">him</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; Milo realised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Potentially, but it&rsquo;s not certain. You&rsquo;ll have to ask him yourself,&rdquo; Ozim explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright, I&rsquo;ll get this job done, Director Ozim. I won&rsquo;t let you down,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Milo, this </span><span class="c4">isn&#39;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an execution. We need you to bring him here. As long as he is not dead, we&#39;re good. We cannot be letting him hurt any more innocent lives,&rdquo; Ozim restated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Milo left his office, he passed the receptionist again. Her smile radiated in the room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo, I won&rsquo;t lie to you. What we&rsquo;re asking is hard. We&#39;re here to help anytime,&rdquo; the receptionist exclaimed. Miles paused and nodded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the autumn leaves swept beneath Star&#39;s feet, a black cat jumped across the street. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Meow!&rdquo; The cat hastily made its way to the shop&#39;s entrance, where Star had lived. Star&#39;s family wasn&#39;t the richest and had owned a measly restaurant that barely earned enough profit to keep them fed and sheltered. Still, Star&#39;s enthusiasm sparked in his unconventional silver hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star was born with Albinism, a rare condition that made his skin and hair lighter. Not only did his silver hair spark at school, his light grey eyes were scary for some. But overall, his outward appearance had visual harmony and attracted girls easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was evident to say Star was quite popular at school. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you see the news?&rdquo; students exclaimed through the hallways. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hazel is dead somehow and Liam has gone missing!&rdquo; others shouted. The school was in a craze after 3 incidents had occurred. Nobody felt safe and everyone thought they were next on a murderer&#39;s list of some sort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star didn&#39;t care. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Ace,&rdquo; Erik nudged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Star replied. &ldquo;What do you want this time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You gonna figure out the meaning behind the murder?&rdquo; Erik asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you come to me? Like I said, I don&#39;t want to be dragged into any drama!&rdquo; Star sighed, slamming his locker shut.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because you&#39;re Ace! You&#39;re known for your insane smarts, please broski!&rdquo; Erik pleaded, clutching on his shirt. Start pushed him back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back off, I already said no. Do your own hero antics,&rdquo; Star scoffed, slinging his backpack on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; Erik groaned. &ldquo;Come to my party tonight!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star ignored Erik&rsquo;s offer and shook his head in frustration. Suddenly, Star saw the same black cat again. It crossed the street softly this time, each step treading with care. It didn&#39;t get hit by a car, and it ran towards Star for a strange reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; Star asked, petting the cute cat. It purred and rubbed itself against Star&#39;s leg. Students walked towards Star as if he was the centre of attention, watching him play with the cat. Star had never liked attention, and he didn&rsquo;t know if it was because of the way he interacted with the cat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cat hissed. Star nervously clutched the cat in his hands and walked home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma! I&#39;m home!&rdquo; Star yelled as he placed the cat outside the store. Again, the seats were empty as he walked inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&#39;s the cat from yesterday!&rdquo; his mother replied. &ldquo;How was school?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Star replied. His mother grabbed a bowl and poured a little milk and placed it on the floor to which the cat happily ran over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why don&#39;t you keep the cat? It certainly thinks our store is nice and cozy,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, what if it is someone else&#39;s?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come on Star, you barely have any friends,&rdquo; his mother scolded. &ldquo;We&#39;ve given you academic goals and you have always crushed them, but apart from that, you&#39;ve done nothing your entire life!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the cat sneezed. Star unfortunately caught a whiff and immediately turned around, somewhat disgusted. His mother laughed but Star wasn&#39;t amused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&#39;mon, stop pushing yourself!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star rolled his eyes as he plopped down his lunch box on the kitchen counter, then walked away into the shadows of his bedroom. He never looked back, Star only ever had one goal in mind. Be the star of the school that aced every test. He didn&#39;t care about what others thought, but it was a clear goal. Heck, he didn&#39;t even know what he was going to pursue after his final year of school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His slow trance towards his room was sluggish compared to the cat&#39;s speed, for it stealthily bolted into the darkness of Star&#39;s room first, pouncing onto his chair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you serious?&rdquo; Star asked, flicking the lights on. He lazily threw his bag down in the corner of his room and got his workbook out with a scrumpled worksheet underneath it. It was extra exercise for math that he had gotten from his teacher. &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cat instead leapt for his bed, swiftly executing a marvelous landing on his soft pillow. Its claws didn&#39;t claw against any of the bedding, and Star was impressed for once. The light bulb suddenly flickered on and off, a strange phenomenon that caught Star&rsquo;s eye. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mom, the light is broken again!&rdquo; Star yelled down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; his mother sighed. &ldquo;I wish your father was still around&hellip;He&rsquo;d know how to fix these things better than me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; Star smiled. He petted the cat gently as he watched his mother help fix the light. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There we go,&rdquo; his mother said. &ldquo;I heard one of your classmates is celebrating something tonight, word from our group chat says it&rsquo;s a big party, are you going to go?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Party? Not my thing mom,&rdquo; Star replied, falling flat on his bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon, you need to go out more! At least go exercise by walking there. If you don&rsquo;t like it, come home, alright?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine&hellip;&rdquo; Star rolled his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cold night breeze was rather chilling, for the temperature had dropped down to a whopping 5 degrees celsius. For an Autumn night, it was quite rare. As Star walked along the footpath to Erik&rsquo;s house, he saw a man sitting on the sidewalk, covered in rugged sheets and a hood. It masked his face and he couldn&rsquo;t imagine what it was like for a homeless guy like him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it also hit Star in the head. Why was a homeless guy in a suburban area?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; Star asked as he approached the man. &ldquo;Are you cold? Why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Read the sign,&rdquo; the man grunted, half asleep. The sign read; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m immortal, kill me now.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Immortal?&rdquo; Star chuckled. &ldquo;As if! Magic doesn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man sighed. He gently touched a flower beside him and it crumbled instantly, then the ash remnants were swept by the breeze. Star was shocked. Suddenly, the man looked up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;I haven&rsquo;t felt this presence in so long&hellip;&rdquo; the man blurted, slowly standing up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um, what are you doing?&rdquo; Star asked. &ldquo;Who are you, and why are you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please, you might be my saving grace. Are you busy at all?&rdquo; the man asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Well, not really,&rdquo; Star replied, smiling awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then, follow me,&rdquo; the man motioned, leading Star away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Sadana&hellip;It might sound ridiculous, but I am no human. I&rsquo;m known to be a Jespan Lord&hellip;&rdquo; Sadana began as they walked through the neighbourhood. It felt magical to Star since he couldn&rsquo;t believe that instead of going to a party, he was talking to a presumed alien that needed his help to be killed. &ldquo;Like you saw what I did to the flower, I am the depiction of decay and death. I can make physical objects undergo rapid decay which turns them into nothing or dust,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Their conversation continued, and Star had followed Sadana to a nearby scrapyard. The monotone landscape spoke of melancholy as Sadana sat down on the hood of a car, sighing. &ldquo;Well, show me your powers kid,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Powers? I don&rsquo;t have any, I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about&hellip;&rdquo; Star replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Focus. Concentrate.&rdquo; Sadana instructed. The dim overhead lights casted subtle shadows that Star began absorbing. &ldquo;Facsinating&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For a cosmic being like Sadana, he could see things Star couldn&rsquo;t. It was the energy that came from the lights overhead, and Sadana observed Star&rsquo;s body reacting to this light energy being directed to him. He absorbed it like fuel, charging something up internally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Try to shoot that car headlight over there,&rdquo; Sadana directed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How do I do that?&rdquo; Star asked. Sadana lazily hopped off the hood of the car and helped Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You aim and channel your inner energy,&rdquo; Sadana guided. Star&rsquo;s eyes began to glow a whitish yellow, and then all of a sudden, a concentrated beam of light shot out, destroying the car headlight instantly. It was surreal to see such magical things happen to Star&rsquo;s body, and he wondered where and when he had gotten this power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah&hellip;&rdquo; Star gasped. &ldquo;I had this power in me all the time?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not sure, kid. I see potential in you,&rdquo; Sadana smiled. &ldquo;Come here tomorrow sometime, I&rsquo;ll teach you more. I&rsquo;m sure you humans need to sleep or something,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Star smiled. &ldquo;You alone here, or what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I believe so. I&rsquo;m alone, disconnected and lonely. I&rsquo;ve got nothing left and worth fighting for so I might as well spend my time teaching you younglings. A new generation of power is vital,&rdquo; Sadana smiled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wanna be friends? You seem nice, plus, people like us need someone to rely on,&rdquo; Star suggested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why I&rsquo;d love to! &lsquo;Til dust do us apart!&rdquo; Sadana exclaimed, waving Star off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next day at school, Star took a different approach. He figured that his powers had something to do with light energy, and he presumed he could store that energy somehow. From his studies, he concluded the electromagnetic spectrum had to be related somehow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ryan just got cancer!&rdquo; students in the hallway chattered. &ldquo;Did you know Harry got sunburnt?&rdquo; &ldquo;In Autumn? That&#39;s nonsense!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Milo got the intercom working again and helped fix all the computers this morning&hellip;&rdquo; more students added. &ldquo;They&#39;ve been bugged all week! I can finally finish my research paper!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star ignored the small talk. Whatever the students were gossiping about, Star just couldn&#39;t unhear it. Cancer? Sunburns? Was it himself causing these phenomenons? He concluded that it could be since his powers drew directly from light, and it could cause burns. UV could cause cancer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Star was walking home again, the black cat remerged. Did it come out of his bedroom again? It was almost like the cat had followed him everyday. Then, he felt it. An ultraviolet wave had just reflected off of his face into a concentrated amount, directed right towards the school principal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star&#39;s eyes widened and took a quick glance but quickly darted back to not draw attention. He knew this was bad. The principal getting cancer? Every sign led to him. He was scared to reveal his power as he knew he was a monster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sadana, I still can&#39;t control my powers&hellip;I&#39;ve learnt what my abilities do, but I can&#39;t seem to restrict it!&rdquo; Star sighed. He etched sketches into the pebbled sand with a steel rod, providing Sadana company in the scrapyard. It was peaceful and a distant place where Star found to connect with deeply, somewhere he began to feel safe. &ldquo;I&#39;m just like you&hellip;how you told me you lost everyone you loved&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&#39;s not about the things you can destroy, it&#39;s about the things you can protect. Unlike me, all I could do was destroy. I didn&#39;t protect anyone,&rdquo; Sadana replied. His advice was quite grim but surprisingly, Star understood what he meant. He was different. He had the chance to prove to everyone he wasn&#39;t a mindless killer. &ldquo;Your powers are different than mine, kid,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell that to my classmate. All of a sudden, he&#39;s the talk of the town,&rdquo; Star began. &ldquo;Fixing a load of electronic devices at school, he&#39;s gained a reputation as a hardware guy! I used to be the one everyone relied on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana was blank. Nothing clicked. Silence took over the conversation for a minute until Sadana breathed heavily through his nose, letting out a deep exhale. &ldquo;There&#39;s no point in comparing yourself with others if you&#39;re supposed to be competing with yourself,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; Star asked angrily. &ldquo;Stop speaking in riddles all the time!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He needed to let off some steam. Sadana sighed yet again and laid down on the scrap metallic sheets. He watched Star destroy and create chaos in the scrapyard. It was the only space he felt free to use his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Director Ozim, I will be commencing my capture of Star very soon,&rdquo; Milo reported, handing an extensive research paper to him. Milo had worked on this project for the past few days without Star noticing him. Though Milo was heavily behind on schoolwork, he was determined to put an end to Star&#39;s massacre.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Thanks for giving me some extra information, this will help a lot,&rdquo; Ozim replied, scanning the document. As he read the document, he realised the ugly truth. &ldquo;This proves my theory. Star has killed these innocents. Over 100. But he doesn&#39;t know his power. This is </span><span class="c4">really</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bad&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s also got a mentor of some sort&hellip;His name was Sadana?&rdquo; Milo added.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sadana? The Jespan Lord of Decay? That&#39;s terrible! I will send my best agents as soon as I can. Don&#39;t rush in! I repeat, do not rush in! Do NOT engage in the fight!&rdquo; Ozim ordered. Sadana was one of the most powerful Jespan Lords and the ISID had merely prepared for this. Was this fate&#39;s doing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I got you. When do I go in?&rdquo; Milo asked. He was prepared. Just like Star had a mentor, Ozim had personally trained Milo to become a stronger agent, teaching him how to maximise his abilities. He felt confident he could beat Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This weekend. Though all my agents are all busy on a separate mission, you must not fail. You want to save lives, correct?&rdquo; Ozim asked. Milo&#39;s conviction to save lives was held in high regard and was indomitable. His will, his goal was almost complete. He nodded in utter truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will not fail you Director Ozim!&rdquo; said Milo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The timing couldn&#39;t get any better as it was the weekend, a Sunday morning when Milo flew out of the training facility Ozim had helped construct for him. It was finally time to capture the killer. As he traversed the electrical currents to his house, Milo thought about the lives he could save. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, Milo knew he couldn&#39;t attack Star head on. He knew his own weaknesses, and knew he would get obliterated easily by Star&#39;s power. He had to get him somewhere dark, and to drain his energy out, so he waited for the perfect time to strike. Milo sneakily watched every move Star performed, following him to the scrapyard in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey Sadana!&rdquo; Star greeted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you supposed to be followed?&rdquo; Sadana asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Star replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then who is that?&rdquo; Sadana pointed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dang! That old dude saw me!&rdquo; Malstrom thought. He had no choice but to reveal himself. He took a deep breath and expected the worst. As he popped his head up, he saw Star and Sadana staring at him expressionless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me, Star?&rdquo; Malstrom asked. &ldquo;I&#39;m in your English class!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&hellip;are you?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Milo!&rdquo; Malstrom cackled. &ldquo;You&hellip;You&rsquo;ve ruined so many lives&hellip;And I will finally put an end to you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me&hellip;?&rdquo; Star asked. &ldquo;What do I have to do with their deaths?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Malstrom unfolded a piece of paper from his pocket and held it against Star&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Look at what you&rsquo;ve done! You killed this girl! Your power of light&hellip;It&rsquo;s killing people!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The image was the same image Director Ozim had shown him. The girl with sunburns and the three men diagnosed with cancer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Star yelled, trying to rip it up. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realise my powers back then, plus, I didn&rsquo;t have control!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lies!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get these powers anyway? Are you getting paid to do this?&rdquo; Star scowled, hurling himself towards Malstrom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Malstrom grunted, pushing Star back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You cannot change the past, Milo! There&rsquo;s no point saving your parents, you have to let it go!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up! Don&rsquo;t talk about my parents!&rdquo; Malstrom roared. His body&rsquo;s voltage rose, the electric energy within himself grew stronger. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t drag them into this mess! I&rsquo;m only trying to save lives!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, but that means I&rsquo;ll be kicking your ass!&rdquo; Star growled, lunging forward at the speed of light. His movements outpaced Malstrom&rsquo;s significantly, beating him easily to a pulp. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Malstrom yelled, running towards a nearby warehouse. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Find me!&rdquo; Star laughed, becoming invisible by absorbing the ultraviolet light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing your games!&rdquo; Malstrom exclaimed, running into the warehouse. Star and Sadana quickly followed, pursuing Malstrom closely. As they entered, the door bolted shut with an electrical locking system.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What happened?!&rdquo; Sadana yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; Star exclaimed, terrified. The window shutters rolled down suddenly, sending a thunderous clatter that echoed in the warehouse. No light leaked in. It was pure darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star&hellip;I know your weakness! No light, no might! I&rsquo;ve rigged the electrical system so that there&rsquo;s no light!&rdquo; Malstrom laughed. Star was frustrated that Malstrom had known his weakness already, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready to give up. He focused his stored energy, allowing his body to emit a dim light that illuminated a small area around him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There, Star saw the enormous warehouse, with shipping containers piled along the walls. Sadana stood motionless next to Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; Sadana commanded, instructing him to take the fight himself. He trusted Star, for he had grown significantly since they first met. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you lifeless!&rdquo; Malstrom yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make sure you meet your parents!&rdquo; Star exclaimed. &ldquo;I bet they would never imagine their son going down this path! They&rsquo;d be better off dead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The words hit Milo hard. Again? His parents? He hated people talking about them. He loved his family, and he didn&rsquo;t want them to die for anything. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just a few more years&hellip;&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all gonna be alright,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If Milo was going to fight, it was going to be for his parents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arghh!&rdquo; Milo launched. The two traded blows at each other, dealing significant damage to the surrounding environment. Milo was careful not to destroy the warehouse too much, otherwise the sunlight would boost Star&rsquo;s power significantly. He also had to defend against Star punching or melting out a hole for sunlight to leak in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Milo landed a direct hit, an electrical surge that tasered Star for a second, paralysing him. In that moment, Milo lunged in and struck Star down, hard into the ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&hellip;out&hellip;&rdquo; Star huffed as he tumbled to the ground. He was exhausted, and it felt over. The warehouse was still dark and no light could enter. Star was powerless. He had run out of fuel. His heart paced faster, wiping the blood from his face. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Out of juice, light boy?&rdquo; Malstrom sniggered as he jumped into the electrical system to recharge his own power. His laugh sounded like a fluctuating electric voltage, sending a chilling sensation down his spine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana looked in disbelief, but knew Star still had the strength and most importantly, the courage to continue fighting. However, Sadana still sighed and decided to give Star just a small glint of hope. He unwillingly swiped at the electric box near the entrance, causing it to disintegrate and reveal the wiring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your moves are too slow, old man!&rdquo; Malstrom laughed, leaping out of a wire and attempting to drag Sadana in with him. His electrical form ignored Sadana&rsquo;s abilities, allowing him to firmly grip his body. &ldquo;I know your limits! The ISID has documented your powers already! Your decaying touch can&rsquo;t chain, it only affects singular materials!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who says I was trying to destroy the warehouse? That&rsquo;s not necessary for victory,&rdquo; Sadana grinned. &ldquo;Brain beats the brawl, that&rsquo;s what Lucina had always said,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up old man!&rdquo; Malstrom spat, ignoring his lecture. He didn&rsquo;t believe Star could win. Malstrom smirked at the exposed wires leading underground now that the box was gone, able to see where he was going. He had devised a plan at that moment, almost executing it instantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the underworld!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ace!&rdquo; Sadana cried as his fingers barely grazed the door. The door began breaking down, leaving nothing but a frame that exposed the sun. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You little!&rdquo; Malstrom roared. His eyes darted around to look for Star, but he was gone. How did he disappear all of a sudden? Unable to react, Malstrom noticed the wire had been broken. He had been forced out, and his grip was still firmly attached to Sadana. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ultraviolet waves are invisible-&rdquo; Star began. &ldquo;I reflected a concentration of UV to burn the wires&hellip;Wither away!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Malstrom finally flew out of the wire, revealing his true, vulnerable human form. A frail looking boy, still holding onto Sadana, was terrified. He forcefully pushed Malstrom away, not wanting to speed up his gradual death. Afterall, he didn&rsquo;t want to fight. It was Star&rsquo;s battle in the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; Malstrom cried. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how those murders happened&hellip;&rdquo; Star explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you, I just didn&rsquo;t have it controlled until recently&hellip;And I&rsquo;m sorry about your parents, I don&rsquo;t even know if I did it to them,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Malstrom wailed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The whole school knows! We all care, but you can&rsquo;t do much! You have to move on!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana was silent. Milo had begun fading. He had killed another. Of course, he felt guilty as he had ended countless lives before with his touch. Innocent lives, gone with a singular touch. Loved ones, withered away with a singular touch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star sighed. He leant down and placed his hand on Milo. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m open to change, willing to help. But whatever you&rsquo;ve done, you&rsquo;ve made yourself worse,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; Milo had faded. His body was gone, decayed into nothing but a pile of ash. Star&rsquo;s heartbeat spiked, staring at the remains of Milo. Sadana quietly stood up and walked to the docks. It was quiet again, and the waves crashed against the rocks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I need to retire. I must find a way to depart from this world&hellip;&rdquo; Sadana began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived for already 2000 years, and I don&rsquo;t think my existence will help humanity in any way,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you can&#39;t leave!&rdquo; Star shouted, reaching out. &ldquo;You still have a lot to teach me!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It hurts for me as well, Ace,&rdquo; Sadana cried. A tear trickled down his face that hung a heavy frown. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to live forever,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What am I supposed to do?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, live. Unlike me, enjoy life for what it is,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But you&#39;re&hellip;But&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Continue to transcend humanity&hellip;Your strength&hellip;It excels far beyond my own&hellip;I sense that I&rsquo;ve met something like you&hellip;2000 years ago&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the sun set, Sadana&#39;s words pierced deep into Star&#39;s heart. He held it firmly, unable to control his emotions. His body bathed beneath the ultraviolet rays of the stars that rose just up ahead. Star gazed up hazily, blinded by his own power. His cold, alien-like hand pressed gently on Star&rsquo;s chest as the sunlight reflected off his face. The decay had begun. &ldquo;Do you understand now, boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sadana&rsquo;s body had begun to wither, his own ability of gamma decay had reflected off of Star. Star hung his head low, unable to face the truth, the harsh truth that stood in front of him. Losing his teacher? No, it was more than that. Losing his only friend, it was. He wasn&rsquo;t a hero. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My powers&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finally controlled them. It&rsquo;s not about why you fight, it&rsquo;s about why you live.&rdquo; Sadana whimpered. &ldquo;Go on, prove to the world that Ace isn&rsquo;t a brutal killing machine&hellip;show your good,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The last thing Star witnessed was Sadana&rsquo;s faint and weak smile. It pained Star so hard internally that he didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to say goodbye. Sadana&rsquo;s decaying body slowly trickled into a fine powder, forming a neat pile on the concrete floor. The breeze carried the dust of his body as he disintegrated, leaving Star gazing at the open sea. He was alone, with overflowing gamma. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry Sadana&hellip;I will make you proud!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, the black cat appeared again. It had magically teleported to the port&#39;s edge. It purred gently, then a sickening meow followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star wailed in pain, so he flew into the sunset at the speed of light, needing to release some steam in his body. The cat waited on the port, waiting for Star to come back. As the night grew colder, Star didn&rsquo;t stop. He didn&rsquo;t want to go back. He couldn&rsquo;t go back. It was stopping him.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.aez6ib2zs0fz"><span class="c3">IV - The Sky that Calls</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Unidentified object entering our airspace!&rdquo; the commander shouted. The control panel had gone mayday when the object had flown into Taiwan airspace. &ldquo;It&#39;s moving so fast! Ready weapons!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Soldiers rushed up to the front line ready to shoot down the unidentified flying object, but it was no use. It flew at the speed of light, circling the southern shore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;What is that </span><span class="c4">thing</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo; the commander yelled. &ldquo;Skye! I need an answer!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Skye Sun was the renowned scientist who had worked under the Taiwanese military, aiding them in scientific and technological advancement. Though he was familiar with such speeds, he trembled in fear. Skye hesitated for a moment, then came to a sudden realisation. &ldquo;That&#39;s no object commander, </span><span class="c4">that&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;my son,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? You mean&hellip;hs&#39;s that experiment you told us?&rdquo; his commander yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, the Elixir of the Sun. It&#39;s the orange serum that we have now&hellip;&rdquo; Skye explained. &ldquo;At first, I believed it could heal my sun due to the high amount of stem-cell-like regenerative proteins. It did, but it came with side effects such as turning his hair white and eyes silver,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Continue&hellip;&rdquo; the commander stroked his beard, curious about Skye&#39;s relationship with this serum. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, after a year, we began noticing strange incidents happening whenever my child was around. He&#39;s a weapon of mass destruction,&rdquo; Skye concluded. &ldquo;He is almost like an alien now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Precisely. An Avidrene to be specific,&rdquo; a voice rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;General Colerico!&rdquo; the commander greeted. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Skye Sun, your son is special. If we&#39;re able to neutralise and control him, we can take down the manipulative and corrupt International Supernatural Intelligence Division. That Jaxton Ozim&hellip;&rdquo; General Colerico exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well Colerico, we&#39;ll be happy to assist. I&#39;m so glad your company Anateros agreed to help strengthen our army. We couldn&#39;t thank you any more for all the firearms and funds you&#39;ve donated to us,&rdquo; the commander thanked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No worries kiddo, we all need a little help,&rdquo; General Colerico smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Colerico! I&#39;ve gotten updates on the lifeform you asked. Look at this development!&rdquo; Skye exclaimed, switching tabs to a monitor that displayed a black goo that formed the shape of a puddle contained in a small box.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So that&#39;s an Avidrene&hellip;&rdquo; the commander inspected. He stroked his spiky beard as he watched the slop of black jump around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ve been monitoring it for a while. It can take the form of anything as long as it has enough mass&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Interesting&hellip;and the serum?&rdquo; General Colerico questioned, smirking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s the Avidrenes&rsquo; blood. It can awaken powers seen in my son,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great to hear the research is coming along. I&#39;ll be presenting to African countries soon about this plan, helping them thrive with a supernatural being. Their abilities and support could greatly benefit them!&rdquo; General Colerico reinforced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What should we do about him sir?&rdquo; the commander asked again, leaning towards the microphone. The lights on the control panels were still blaring a loud alarm that pulsed a red light. The commander quickly switched the alarm off and fiddled with the controls. Barton swung on his thick coat, decorated with Anateros&rsquo; white and green logo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry, leave Star to me,&rdquo; General Colerico explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bring your son down for a long overdue reunion.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Star soared across the skyline, Colerico pulled out a mirror. It reflected the pale, orange rays of the sun that alerted Star. Slowly, he approached the hillside where Barton Colerico stood firm, confronting Star.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star Sun?&rdquo; Barton asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this light about?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, to get your attention. Your father is with us. I know it&rsquo;s a surprise to know that he&rsquo;s alive, but he&rsquo;s trying his best. I know you miss him, so why not come in for a reunion?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My&hellip;my father?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The next thing Star knew was that he was in a futuristic lab of some sort with big, italicised sans serif letters that spelt out &lsquo;Anateros&rsquo;. The walls were slick adorned with geometric shapes with huge amounts of reinforced glass to allow for easy inspection. There were various advanced machinery present, and an armory full of powerful equipment for military use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Taiwan&rsquo;s a country in need of freedom. Chained down by the powerful CCP, we&rsquo;ve been helping them to fight back against the powerhouse the mainland has,&rdquo; Barton described. &ldquo;Anateros is an ambitious company. We always try our best for the freedom and betterment of all people. No one should be in chained down like this,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star resonated with the company&rsquo;s message heavily. Fighting for the betterment of everyone? Yes please! His own interpretation of the company made him believe they not only helped countries, but also people to become better. He leant on the notion that the company underscored the value of teaching younger teenagers like him on how to navigate the corrupt world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We do what the world won&rsquo;t. We arm the helpless. We teach the forgotten. Yes, it&rsquo;s messy, but hope has always been forged in fire.&rdquo; Barton reiterated. He stood proud in emphasising the company&rsquo;s message, believing Star had complete trust in him and his colleagues. As Star walked past large vials containing black serum like liquid, a strange sensation crept down his spine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; Barton guided. &ldquo;Skye! Your son is here,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad&hellip;?&rdquo; Star whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star? Is that really you?&rdquo; Skye asked, his voice quivering in excitement. The two shared a long lasting hug that felt like an eternity until Star pushed back with a nervous and grim expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you leave me&hellip;?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for never telling you son&hellip;&rdquo; Skye began. &ldquo;I truly apologise. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything from the beginning tomorrow morning,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star woke up the next day in his dad&rsquo;s apartment in Taiwan, completely discarding his previous life back in Singapore. It was a fresh change, but something he craved for. His previous routine was miserable, and now, it felt like he was in control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning son, how&rsquo;d you sleep?&rdquo; Skye asked. He was still in his pajamas, pouring a nice cup of coffee with his phone in the other hand. He scrolled the latest news where the headline titled &lsquo;Mysterious Object Scales Shore&rsquo;. &ldquo;You want me to start from the beginning, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star sat down at the kitchen island and stretched out. &ldquo;Enlighten me,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, when you were 3, you had a chronic heart disease. You were our only son, so I tried everything to save you,&rdquo; Skye narrated. &ldquo;I left soon after I realised that it was impossible to cure you, but your mother didn&rsquo;t give up. But when I went on an expedition to Bulan Island, I discovered a black, liquid-like carcass that dripped orange blood. After taking it back to the lab, I-&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me guess, you used that orange blood on me and I got cured?&rdquo; Star interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skye chuckled, then gently placed down his mug &ldquo;Yes, but it also caused you to grow your silver eyes and white hair. You used to have black hair and brown eyes. Your skin was also slightly darker as well. Basically so, the blood also gave you powers. Your mother brought you back to her home, Singapore after we realised you caused unnecessary deaths. In other words, you&rsquo;ve had your powers since you were 3, and now and only now are you learning to control them,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know that, but exactly how many people have I killed?&rdquo; Star asked angrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Skye sighed, and warned Star with a grim look that he was even embarrassed to say. &ldquo;Approximately 500,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star almost fell out of his chair when he heard the number and struggled to regain his balance. He was absolutely lost for words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sat in silence while his father sipped at his coffee quietly, trying not to disturb his train of thought. 500 deaths was more than he had imagined. He knew his powers were uncontrolled, but this level of danger was too far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if you&rsquo;ve controlled your powers yet, but Barton&rsquo;s eager goals for Anateros to help people could greatly be impacted by you. You could help us do a lot of good with your powers, you know? It makes up for the people you&rsquo;ve killed,&rdquo; Skye offered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s a start. I&#39;m glad I&rsquo;m back with you dad,&rdquo; Star smiled. &ldquo;Can I get a coffee too?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Director Ozim, Beijing is breathing down our necks,&quot; Agent Chen whispered as she slid a classified folder across his desk. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim reluctantly opened the file, revealing surveillance photos of Taiwanese military officials meeting with Barton. He sighed, then leant his face into his palms. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did Milo succeed in neutralising Star?&rdquo; Ozim asked worriedly, peeking up from his hands that masked his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s disappeared sir,&rdquo; Agent Chen reported nervously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim slammed against his desk, displacing his pencil holder. He was slightly frustrated that Star was still not controlled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s killing people and he doesn&rsquo;t know! We can&#39;t have another incident, otherwise our reputation will plummet again! What&rsquo;s the status of Star?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s now with Anateros. That&rsquo;s what our sources say,&rdquo; Agent Chen replied, becoming increasingly more terrified by Ozim&rsquo;s actions. This time, Ozim didn&rsquo;t throw a fit. He didn&#39;t lash out. Instead, he took a deep breath before his next words. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, I know. But there&rsquo;s a larger issue at hand. Beijing has also gotten word of this information and is worried of a potential attack. The UN Security Council is already drafting potential solutions about &#39;unregulated supernatural warfare&#39; threatening regional stability.&quot; Chen interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ozim&#39;s stress was clear. He was lost in thought. &ldquo;I hate politics&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chen&#39;s voice dropped further, continuing from her last point. &quot;Sir, if we don&#39;t contain this situation, Beijing has implied they&#39;ll handle this issue themselves. They&#39;re talking about outright killing Star.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ozim closed the file, his jaw tightening. &ldquo;We can&#39;t let him die! He&#39;s just another kid like Elias! The ISID is meant to protect humanity from supernatural threats! We&#39;ve helped similar people like the zodiacs. </span><span>Star</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;isn&#39;t much different!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do we do then sir?&rdquo; Agent Chen asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Ozim leant forward in his chair, he rubbed his forehead painfully. &ldquo;Call and dispatch Elias on this job. I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s busy. This needs to be shut down. China isn&rsquo;t going to be happy with us if we fail this commission,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This wasn&#39;t the first time the ISID had called him. It was a date night, and he hated to be interrupted on special occasions. But ISID considered this to be urgent, and he expected any case directed to him was the most notorious and difficult. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, there wasn&#39;t really a notoriously difficult case ever for Elias Novem. He had gotten a master&#39;s degree in anthropology when he was younger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you serious? At this time? Fine. Whatever. $25,000? Alright. I&#39;m on it,&rdquo; Elias sighed, hanging up. &ldquo;Sorry babe, but work called again, another case,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Again? Fine. Better not miss next time,&rdquo; his girlfriend scoffed, dissatisfied yet again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star jumped onto his cosmic hoverboard and flew off into the skies, actively chasing his target. &ldquo;Any insight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Target&#39;s name is Star Sun. He has abilities to absorb and reflect all types of electromagnetic radiation,&rdquo; Agent Chen explained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A light user eh?&rdquo; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Remember, he&#39;s dangerous. Neutralise him and bring him to us. Don&#39;t fail Novem, you&#39;re our last hope. If you can&#39;t do this, no one can. The stake of hundreds of innocent lives is at risk,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course I won&#39;t fail, I&#39;m Elias Novem!&rdquo; Elias grinned side to side. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hours passed when Elias finally arrived in Japan. He was desperately craving some food, so he stopped for the night for ramen and some sleep. Afterall, he was human. He needed sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias continued his search for Star in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Update on Star: We&#39;ve gotten insider information that he&#39;s training with Anateros. He&#39;s been learning how to fight stronger and sharper,&rdquo; Agent Chen informed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure. I think I&#39;ve gotten a reading of him training above the sea,&rdquo; Elias replied. &ldquo;I&#39;ll update you and Ozim soon,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Despite the warnings Chen had given, Elias thought little. He could handle various situations and even in the worst of them, always find a clever solution. As he approached the target, a pale white silhouette emerged upon the serene waters of the South China Sea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you Star?&rdquo; Elias asked, facing the hovering boy with white hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes? Who might you be?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Elias Novem, I work for the ISID. Now, I don&rsquo;t want to fight, but you&rsquo;re becoming a big threat to humanity right now&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right here? Are you serious?&rdquo; Star scoffed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hovering right above the South China Sea!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it minimises collateral damage,&rdquo; Elias laughed off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to the ISID!&rdquo; Star grunted, lunging towards Elias. Elias launched off his cosmic hoverboard, dodging Star&rsquo;s attack. Star quickly turned invisible with the sun shining directly against his body, reflecting UV rays towards Elias. Elias stumbled forward, reeling from the hit, swinging blindly in the air. He didn&rsquo;t know where Star was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias lunged down into the cold waters of the sea to slow down the UV burns. As he peeped above the waters, Star emerged, striking Elias but to no avail. The waters helped Elias dodge, refracting the light, slowing his movements. Star struggled slightly underwater due to the water absorbing some of the light, but enough refracted light helped him maintain his energy levels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see you now, flash!&rdquo; Elias laughed, launching off a cosmic weight he created. As he traversed the waters, he manifested mirrors in certain locations. &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mirrors? I see through your trap. I know how light works!&rdquo; Star exclaimed, avoiding hitting the mirrors to end up in an endless loop. The two traded blows at each other causing large waves upon the sea surface, with Star throwing a deadly punch on Elias that sent him flying out of the waters. &ldquo;No more underwater playtime!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle continued. It was truly intense, each attack being blocked or countered. Each UV ray Star directed was reflected by a cosmic mirror Elias created, and Elias&rsquo;s cosmic manifestations were outsped every time he tried to attack. The two were exhausted after hours, both landing with a deafening thud on the southern shore of Taiwan. They were back to where they had started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you killed me?&rdquo; Elias groaned, all tired and wet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an Avidrene right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah and? What&rsquo;s killing going to do for me?&rdquo; Star scoffed, coughing up sand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we fighting for then?&rdquo; Elias asked dumbfoundingly. He sighed as he watched the clouds overhead pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh manically, then turning to his side to see Elias needing a break. &ldquo;Ourselves I guess,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Being a detective makes me question everything,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;I studied anthropology and got a masters&rsquo;, and here I am, some superhero unable to complete his mission. This world baffles me,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fight like a human,&rdquo; Star interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not technically human, like you. We&rsquo;re both hybrids used as weapons by our respective owners&hellip;&rdquo; Elias replied. He sat up, dusting off the sand off his indigo costume. &ldquo;Let me tell you, I know what Avidrenes are better than anyone else. My closest friend is a Jespan, and she&rsquo;s told me that Avidrenes in ancient times were the predator of Jespans,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star jerked up, shaking the sand out of his hair. &ldquo;What? You&rsquo;re saying Avidrenes are predators so I&rsquo;m supposed to be stronger than you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Avidrenes are creatures of the sun. After the Jespans discovered the mythical mineral of Orichalcum, they fought back against the Avidrenes,&rdquo; Elias clarified. He sighed again, then lent out a hand. &ldquo;Team-up?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Us? Aren&rsquo;t we supposed to be destined enemies?&rdquo; Star asked reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who says? No one writes the rules better than us. Plus, if both of our parent companies are up to no good, it&rsquo;s better if we do something. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re unstoppable together,&rdquo; Elias offered, giving a concerned look deep into Star&rsquo;s silver eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star shook his hand firmly and closed his eyes. &ldquo;Elias was it? You seriously trust me with my powers&hellip;?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If trust isn&rsquo;t the most powerful thing, then we&rsquo;d have no purpose,&rdquo; Elias smiled, helping Star up. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go catch a break,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two circled the South China Sea, getting the steam off their chest. It wasn&#39;t much, but the two found this method to be relaxing. The serene sounds of the waves with the ambient wind and chirps muffled all the noise outside. Star was alone in mind, finally having no thoughts fogging his vision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is so nice&hellip;&rdquo; Star said happily, bathing in the golden sunlight. It felt extremely calming now that he knew he needed to control his powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Controlling your powers isn&#39;t hard. It&#39;s about how you use them,&rdquo; Elias chuckled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Star agreed, slowly coming to the realisation that they weren&#39;t so different after all. &ldquo;You really enjoy anthropology, don&#39;t you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias smirked, glancing at Star who threw a silly laugh. &ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I still don&#39;t understand how your creations work,&rdquo; Star playfully mocked as he plopped himself in the sea to cool down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s cosmic energy. I can manifest it into tangible objects,&rdquo; Elias grinned, flexing a massive longsword that he had just created out of thin air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sunset marked the slow flight back to the shore, where the two needed to figure out where exactly they needed to go next. It was quite difficult making a move, with both the ISID and Anateros watching over their two children.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dawn sang a quiet melody that woke Star up. The two had found a nice hotel to stay the night, and were enjoying each others&rsquo; company. The half-opened window allowed the cool, crisp morning air to seep into the cozy hotel room where Star woke to a minty sensation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was something happening. Something unusual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias! Wake up!&rdquo; Star nudged the half-asleep Elias until he frustratingly turned over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Elias replied scornfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star pointed out the window, towards the empty horizon. &ldquo;Look. What&#39;s that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then, a black cloud emerged. As it got closer, tiny black specks that looked to be helicopters came into view and Elias knew something was wrong. Ozim had tracked where he was. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shit! Ozim thinks I&#39;m captured! This is bad!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well what do we do?&rdquo; Star asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s gonna be a war, but we need to try to stop it. If we put our powers together, we&#39;ll get through anything. Let&#39;s roll!&rdquo; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The helicopters weren&#39;t slow at all and began mowing down the southern Taiwan shore. The engines grew closer and battle was imminent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Skye, we need to move. ISID is invading our territory! Arm up and let&#39;s fight. Get me that hypnosis gun, now!&rdquo; Barton ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! Our greatest weapon; my son! We can win and take down Jaxton Ozim!&rdquo; Skye laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Let&#39;s make sure they are disbanded by tonight, shall we?&rdquo; Barton snorted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">---</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eat this!&rdquo; Skye began shooting at the invading ISID helicopters that descended upon their territory. The helicopters dropped men down, where Anateros forces fought back forcefully. Black and purple vested ISID soldiers began emerging from the shore, engaging in battle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star and Elias were stuck amidst the battle, together. They trusted each other and knew what they were fighting for. No, Elias wasn&#39;t fighting for the ISID as a loyal agent. Neither was Star fighting for Anateros as a family member. They were fighting for themselves, against all odds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The battle rampaged on from all fronts, the ISID sending in trained agents to quickly deescalate the battle meanwhile Anateros directed elite fighters to minimise damage against their laboratory. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Help me here!,&rdquo; Barton ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right away sir,&rdquo; his pilot replied, getting the helicopter ready. It stealthily found its way into the skies, the engines being masked by the tyrannical sounds of battle. Star sped around the battlefield, disarming and knocking out soldiers. He knew not to kill them, but to minimise the conflict between the two sides. He didn&#39;t want any unnecessary deaths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He got away with the serum!&rdquo; Star yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait Star! Don&#39;t chase after them!&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, creating a rope to pull him back. But it was already too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You need to learn to control better,&rdquo; Barton informed menacingly. &ldquo;Skye! Let me help you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Star paused, realising what was happening. Barton snickered from the helicopter, aiming his rifle at him. A roaring boom sent a deadly toxin towards Star who didn&#39;t react in time, inhaling the chemicals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star! Don&rsquo;t worry! I&rsquo;ll guide you!&rdquo; Skye exclaimed. &ldquo;It&#39;s my hypnosis serum! Don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t hurt you any bit!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The serum worked quite effectively as Star jumped up after falling back onto the ground, causing ISID helicopters to come crashing down in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Elias was forced to create nets to catch the soldiers who operated the planes, making sure not a single life was taken. He knew Star better. He knew Star would never want to do anything like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Elias looked up, Barton was long gone with the serum taken away. Was he going to create another hybrid? It was too risky to follow him. He needed to save Star right here and right now. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ace, I know you&#39;re in there!&rdquo; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! Don&#39;t listen to him! He&#39;s manipulating you!&rdquo; Skye yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaaargh!&rdquo; Star yelled, letting out an uncontrolled burst. His scream tore through the valleys and ripped into the sky. A chain of concentrated UV rays tore through the landscape, rapidly destroying nearby organisms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; Elias yelled. He couldn&#39;t do anything. He was powerless against Skye. He was Star&#39;s dad. Star, who was still in immense pain, tried to fight back against the control serum, trying to regain his powers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! The International Supernatural Intelligence Division has my son as the most wanted supernatural anomaly! I won&#39;t allow you to kill him!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We&#39;re not trying to kill him!&rdquo; Elias yelled. &ldquo;I didn&#39;t even know that he was the most wanted either!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s what they all say!&rdquo; Skye spat, unloading another magazine of the gun. Elias formed another shield, blocking every bullet. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Star, kill him! Without </span><span class="c4">him</span><span class="c0">, the ISID will never thrive!&rdquo; Skye ordered. Star&#39;s body thrusted forward, lunging towards Elias. Elias didn&#39;t flinch, nor did he dodge. He knew who was inside that body. He knew his limitations. He closed his eyes and the speeding flash missed. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star was internally fighting the battle of his life. His father&rsquo;s words lingered deep, penetrating through his heart and into his soul.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon Star! You told me and Barton you wanted the world to be a better place right?&rdquo; the words etched. Meanwhile, Elias&rsquo;s enchanting persona carved into his mind, encouraging for who he was. &ldquo;No one writes better rules than us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, something had cut through the voices, something that silenced the vibrations. It was a boiling hot sensation that ruptured all the lies. He had never felt such power before being enchanted into his body. There was only one explanation to this. The sun was at its peak, and the light had shone through the darkness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would kill you but I&#39;ve promised to never kill anyone again,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;Let me ask you the question: Do you think the Sun rules the sky?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A blinding flash struck Skye. He gasped for air as another hit pummelled against his stomach. &ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d do this&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sun had struck noon and Star had achieved his peak strength, able to absorb all of the light that was cast upon him from the sun. For a minute, he was untouchable, invincible. Elias remained still, without a single movement. Chaos followed Star everywhere as his powers surged, the energy of the sun overflowing. He squirmed and spasmed everywhere, while still trying to maintain himself through the hypnosis dart. Although the energy seemed uncontrolled, Star somehow maintained balance within.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Star! Kill him! You&#39;re invincible!&rdquo; Skye yelled. &ldquo;Trust me son! You are </span><span class="c4">our </span><span class="c0">ace card!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;I won&#39;t listen to anyone!&rdquo; </span><span>Star</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;roared, almost going supernova with the sheer amount of light absorbed. His vision began to flash, unable to see ahead of him. Instead of the grim barrage of gun-fire and conflict, death, decay and violent visions reentered his sights. It felt surreal, as if he had gone back in time and saw a different perspective of his killings. An invincible machine at noon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Star knew he couldn&#39;t control it, but he had some idea of nullifying the damage he would cause. He sped towards the sea and dove deep, letting his excess energy explode into the deep sea. The sudden plunge into the chilling waters fractured the hypnosis, snapping himself out of his rampage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The stored light energy within his body exploded outwards into sharp piercing beams, creating a small shockwave underwater, destroying nearby organisms. Of course Star knew this would happen as water was a great absorber of UV, and this catastrophically reduced the risk of a surface level explosion of his UV energy. He remained underwater, slowly floating towards the surface. The warm, refracted light slowly seeped into his body yet again, giving him strength to continue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Try me,&rdquo; Elias smirked, glancing towards the horizon. His ignorance frustrated Skye, </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;You monster&hellip;&rdquo; Skye wheezed. He wasn&#39;t extremely injured, but in pain. &ldquo;My son&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Elias sighed, his voice filled with disappointment. Though the battle was long over, he saw Skye was still lost in his head. </span><span>Star,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was still nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t over!&rdquo; Skye yelled as he lunged towards Elias. Again, he stood still, knowing exactly what would happen. He had no intent to fight. Just like he presumed, Star bolted up in an instant and gripped his father&#39;s fist of fury, stopping him right in his tracks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dad! It&#39;s no use. Stop hurting my friend!&rdquo; Star yelled. &ldquo;The hypnosis! You made it for me, right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Skye hesitated, then lowered his fist and reverted his stance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&#39;s just that&hellip;You don&#39;t accept me for who I am&hellip;You don&#39;t trust me, but I&#39;m actually all grown up&hellip;I&#39;m fine right now and I understand that I&#39;m not a human anymore. But either way, I&#39;m still your son!&rdquo; Star blurted. He hugged his father tightly. &ldquo;I love you, dad.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His father paused for a moment, unable to process what was happening. Elias smiled, realising Star still had so much potential. The Son of the Sun. An Avidrenes-Human hybrid. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you saying son?&rdquo; Skye asked. &ldquo;Am I&hellip;wrong? Should I have not saved you back then?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, you&#39;ve made me realise my purpose, and my need for control and change,&rdquo; Star smiled tiredly. He was exhausted from controlling himself from the hypnosis. &ldquo;Just&hellip;believe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&#39;s right. Although you worked with Anateros, I&#39;ll let you off the hook.&rdquo; Elias explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ISID helicopters began to descend in peace, ready to collect Elias back. Anateros stood their ground firm, though not aggressive towards the ISID. For once, the two companies were neutral. No fight, just peace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Armed ISID men cuffed Skye for now, needing to confirm if Barton&rsquo;s evil scheme had to do with manipulating the Taiwanese government. His bounty was indeed high, so any affiliations were tense. Then, two shadowy figures emerged from the helicopter. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The public collateral damage was low, but the suspended battle along the southern shore still disturbed the public, causing public riot. Media and news outlets had already begun to document this conflict, and the Mainland Government was eyeing Taiwan&#39;s actions very closely. The true battle was far from over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, what the hell are you thinking?&rdquo; Ozim yelled as he got off the helicopter. &ldquo;We need to go, now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m not going back yet. I&#39;ve got something I need to do.&rdquo; Elias exclaimed, his voice filled with enthusiasm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! You can&rsquo;t just deny my orders, we need you back at base!&rdquo; Ozim demanded. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Star, care to join me to take down a Jespan Lord? This one&#39;s having a bloodbath in Alaska,&rdquo; Elias grinned, excited for their next adventure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You sure duo?&rdquo; Star replied. &ldquo;Call me Ace now on. I&#39;m not digging Star anymore.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two flew off into the sky, radiating immense energy that was strong enough to tear apart any challenges that faced their way. Ozim watched in disappointment, but knew that Elias was a special boy. One that radiated kindness and the qualities of a great leader. Skye watched in hope, believing his son could finally see that the sky was not a mere limit. Ace could finally see the light clearer than ever.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.i2k0ui7ciiwv"><span class="c3">V - The Golden Bull that Sleeps</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Eastern edges of Alaska were colder than usual, and Locke sat quietly beside the fractured ice. The ice spikes had permuted the barren landscape of frozen water somehow, adorned with scattered pillaring mounds of snow. It was a different scene from the previous years, and it was all thanks to the cosmic disruptions that had been happening recently. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke had ventured into the Alaskan wilderness for isolation. He disliked his powers. It caused too much harm to the public. At least that&#39;s what he had thought. When the International Supernatural Intelligence Division requested to train him, he declined. Locke, like his special comrades, was the manifestation of the Taurus zodiac. Even though his ability was destructive, he viewed it as an inconvenience. Though he was able to deflect projectile attacks back at 200% power, he felt his ability wasn&#39;t useful, unlike his other comrades who had abilities that increased daily routine efficiency. It was rather destructive than functional.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been a tough few months ever since the awakening of the sleeping beasts within the Earth, the cosmic energy had begun to resurge from the depths of the planet&rsquo;s core. Again, all he could dream about was the tragedies and situations he had been forced into. With his powers, great responsibility overshadowed him, and he knew for a fact although he could face these challenges when presented, there was a much dangerous underlying threat he had to conquer. Surprisingly, it was his own power, his deflections of projectiles often dealt too much damage, creating collateral damage on the surrounding environment. Of course, it did more harm than good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This drove Locke to find his true self as part of his initial personality was quite resistant to change. He wanted to see the world clearly, so he needed to clear his mind somewhere disconnected with the contemporary world. He needed to bathe in nature and meditate, he would say to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Alaska was the perfect place and Locke felt at home. Away from the Russian conflicts but with still the cold weather, Locke found Northway home. It was remote but cozy, small and quiet. He admired the scenic routes the most, believing it was a much better experience than back in his true home of Russia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke smiled at the sight of the distant lands. Truly breathtaking. His breath fogged up the cold air as he dusted the tiny speckles of ice off his worn leather gloves. His heavy wolf fur jacket rustled against the chilling winds, but Locke was resistant. Years of surviving in the Russian winter had increased his cold endurance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The daylight was already beginning to seep into the eternal darkness the Alaskan nights had offered and Locke was ready to retreat to his cabin. As Locke hiked back the way he had come, a roaring growl cut through the skies, terrifying him. He almost slipped into the devastating icy waters, but he managed to miraculously maintain his balance. His steel capped boots were somewhat drenched as he felt a small, sharp pain enter his foot. It was cold, sudden, and freezing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His cabin wasn&#39;t far now, it was only 200 metres away. He had to hurry as Alaskan nights weren&#39;t the prettiest. His footsteps crackled through the textured ground, each step crunching solid ice or other small debris. Though his right foot was still wet, Locke carried on forward, ignoring the discomfort in his boot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; a voice echoed. Locke froze in motion. It seemed to have come from somewhere behind, so Locke quickly scanned the area. A pressure like wet sand pressed down on his chest and the air suddenly became too thick to breathe. A different chill, varied from the numbing sensation the ice near his feet emitted, gnawed from within. The surrounding snow seemed to quiver, its surface fracturing into tiny ridges as if recoiling from the figure above. Locke gradually gazed upwards, turning to a hologram-like projection of a fist faded into his blurry view. &ldquo;What is this cosmic presence I see in you, boy?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&hellip;are you?&rdquo; Locke asked, his voice laced in fear. His body trembled, not at the mysterious projection, but the sudden drop in temperature. It was much colder than it was seconds ago, and there was nothing Locke could see that would&#39;ve affected the temperature. His breath hitched, even though he was one of Russia&#39;s strongest wrestlers. &ldquo;What are you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Who are you? What is this, this putrid scent that comes from you? This aroma&hellip;it reeks! How could the cosmic deities grant someone like you such powers? Even so, I&#39;d believe you&#39;re quite weak!&rdquo; the projection laughed. &ldquo;Well, I think it would be rather rude to kill you without letting you know my name&hellip;Remember me as Behatar, the Jespan Lord of Strength!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Behatar&hellip;&rdquo; Locke muttered. &ldquo;You won&#39;t defeat me this easily!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke hurled himself forwards towards the projection, holding it back like a physical object. He imagined he would have fallen forward through it as he initially thought it was an illusion, but this confirmed his suspicions. It was a manifestation from cosmic energy. The two opposing sides exerted force onto each other, with Locke&#39;s feet anchored in the ground. He pushed with all his might to restrict the projection, but it was merely enough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The projection had an otherworldly weight and strength, and it shot an unnatural pressure onto his chest. The bone-deep cold air slowly seeped through his mouth, making his breath hurt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hehahaha!&rdquo; Behatar snickered, tirelessly pushing forward and knocking Locke onto the ground. His projection faded as he transformed back into human form. &ldquo;You don&#39;t look strong. I&#39;ll beat you with my bare hands!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke staggered back up, brushing snow off his coat. His heartbeat was calm, but his body ached from that single push. Behatar rushed head first towards Locke without a plan. He was out for blood. The minor detail Behatar failed to realise was that Locke used to be a professional Russian kickboxer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The first blow Behatar attempted to land was a devastating sledgehammer, but Locke swiftly avoided the brutal attack, attacking with a counter to Behatar&#39;s legs. He fell forward, where Locke followed his first attack by slamming him into the uneven ground.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar tried to weave away, but Locke locked his arm around his neck, placing him into a chokehold. Behatar couldn&#39;t believe what was happening. In desperation, he threw a fury of punches, all not budging upon their landing on Locke&#39;s torso.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You said you&#39;re going to kill me?&rdquo; Locke spat, eyeing the mysterious man down. &ldquo;And you call yourself what?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar&#39;s eyes strained red, his expression overflowing with anger. His mind raced in fury and bravado bled out of him like a punctured artery. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; Behatar yelled, transforming into a dagger and stabbing Locke deep in his forearm. Suddenly, Behatar&#39;s projection grew larger and elegantly changed form into an axe. &ldquo;I&#39;ll kill you without mercy!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The axe began chasing after Locke relentlessly, following everywhere he went. Locke tried to hide behind trees and various shelters, but the axe came through and destroyed every last layer that camouflaged him in the midnight scene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke vaulted over splintered logs, his boots slipping through the grassy ice as he tried to manoeuvre away from the impending axe. His movements were quick, blurring the dense backdrop of trees, but not quick enough to mask the axe. Each step he took in the uneven snow became riskier as he knew himself, there were hidden holes and jagged roots underneath that could throw him off easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The axe&rsquo;s whistle seemed to grow sharper, slicing through the night with mechanical hunger. It sought after Locke&#39;s body like a homing missile, only growing faster and deadlier the longer it spent in pursuit. Ultimately, Locke caved in with exhaustion, with the axe striking him brutally in his right shoulder, forcing him to tumble forwards at the footstep of his cabin&#39;s door. Locke weakly grunted as he reached up, trying to stand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This last strike will blow you away!&rdquo; Behatar laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, you&#39;re a homing projectile eh? You launch yourself&hellip;Although I promised to never use my powers, I think you deserve this punishment!&rdquo; Locke yelled, turning around to face Behatar. He wasn&#39;t cowardly like Behatar, admitting Behatar&#39;s dominance. But that didn&#39;t stop Locke. He hadn&#39;t unleashed his power, yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Pain throbbed in his arm, but he focused on the rhythm of his breathing, forcing it into an even pace. The world narrowed as he gained tunnel vision onto Behatar. He had felt this weight before, just weeks ago where he threatened the lives of many. But this time, he was alone and disconnected, free to unleash his growing rage that bled fury inside him. The golden bull was finally and truly awoken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke stood up heroically, forcing his bleeding arm into his x-pose. The sudden jerk sent a sharp pain, but Locke stood stoic, maintaining his calm. He set his legs apart, arms straight and chest upright. His stance was near perfect, and all he had to do was to wait. Locke knew, at that exact moment, Behatar was going down. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&#39;t block my attacks! I&#39;ll cut right through you!&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed with a sinister grin, as he readied his final blow. Locke took a deep breath and concentrated deeply. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Behatar confidently transformed into his next form, an even larger arrow aimed at Locke&#39;s heart, Locke lunged towards the projection as it sped downwards towards his body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously? Giving me a free kill!&rdquo; Behatar mocked as he cast the arrow deep into his arm again. But this time, something was different. He didn&#39;t feel anything, the arrow didn&#39;t penetrate through his skin. Instead, it bounced off gently like a ball.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The arrow slowly began to carve impossible spirals through the air, its sleek form twisting in ever-tightening loops as it pursued the nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed, realising the power Locke had had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I deflect projectiles back at the caster,&rdquo; Locke scowled as he spat out blood. He ruthlessly wiped the blood with his already bloodied hand as he marched forward towards the arrow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s the target?&rdquo; Behatar asked in horror. His voice from the projection screamed fear, each word muttered carrying a heavy tremble. &ldquo;Who is it targeting?!?!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You should know better,&rdquo; Locke spat. He was tired and cold, with Behatar&#39;s existence being a major disturbance in his mood. Locke maintained his distance, making sure to not interfere with the paradox he had just created. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each circuit grew more frantic and more desperate, with its trails forming geometric patterns against the darkening sky. Reality began to strain at the edges of its path, the very fabric of space warping under the weight of such absolute contradiction. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Behatar, by deflecting this arrow, it targets you, but if you are the arrow, it will never reach its goal. Unless you transform out, you&#39;re stuck forever,&rdquo; Locke laughed manically. Behatar knew he didn&#39;t stand a chance if he transformed out. He would instantly be beaten to a pulp by Locke, even as the Jespan Lord of Strength. His strength never came through his physical prowess, rather his transformative prowess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the arrow continued to spiral, a dark hole began to slowly emerge, ripping space itself. A small crack had opened towards a void of some sort. The contradiction couldn&#39;t exist for much longer as the universe couldn&#39;t maintain its paradoxical state, forcing it into a place of unknown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;I will be back! I will escape the void! I am not dead yet, boy!&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed as he entered the void. As the last strands of energy were sucked into the gate, the tear in space collapsed on itself, closing the portal to the void. Locke stumbled forward, almost losing his balance again. He was hurt terribly and needed assistance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Alaskan night didn&rsquo;t help his slow trudge back inside his cabin. Each action he attempted was a sudden shock in his nerve system, sending a tingling pain that lingered for seconds. His arm was weak, with each minuscular action barely moving him forward. Eventually with his slow and careful steps to regain his balance, he walked into his cabin where warmth comforted his coldness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;International Supernatural Intelligence Division, how can I help you?&rdquo; the charming voice spoke from the other end of the line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cosmic anomaly. His name is Behatar&hellip;&rdquo; Locke mumbled, with sudden fluctuations in pitch. He was treating his wounds while attempting to communicate the potential threat he had just encountered. Was this just a mere coincidence? Perhaps not. He believed it was an intentional attack. He knew Behatar was going to be back. He didn&#39;t want him back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Locke set the phone down and leaned heavily against the cabin&rsquo;s window frame. The cosily lit fireplace spread warmth in his blood, letting him rest calmly. Outside, the night raged on. Something inside the void was brewing with trouble and Locke could somehow feel the cosmic disturbance. He knew for a fact, whatever he had faced was something of a cosmic deity, causing destruction upon his home. </span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.59zdxkgm4nf6"><span class="c3">VI - The Water that Cries</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella&#39;s soft hands brushed along the bevelled patterns of her stained porcelain vase under the morning sun. It was another day alone back home in Kathmandu. It had been a month since her last proper job, and she was running low on money, again. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though Stella had completed the mandatory education, companies didn&#39;t bother to bat an eye towards her. She was unnaturally charming, sharing a strong sense of independence that contradicted her likeable nature. Though Stella saw this trait as something unique and fresh, employers didn&#39;t agree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The only company that supported Stella&#39;s life was the International Supernatural Intelligence Division, offering her monthly funds that barely allowed for her to survive. It most importantly paid rent to her small apartment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; Stella sighed, tossing another idea into her vase. She had woken up early as she was hunting for innovative ideas that could perhaps kickstart her own business so she didn&#39;t need to perform odd jobs to have a meal a day. &ldquo;Useless&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each word and sketch she scribbled onto her notebook ended up unrealistic. Stella knew her capability, and the last thing she wanted was to start something that she couldn&#39;t maintain. The vase, instead of her supernatural ability, had now transformed into a bin, directing trash into an endless abyss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her vase was more than just a supernatural artifact, it had also acted like her pet. It followed everywhere she went, invisible to the human eye. She had grown used to it, and used it as a tool in her daily routine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although she was skeptical of the vase just weeks prior when first discovering it, her attitude had calmed, accepting the fact supernatural phenomenons were common on Earth. At least, that was what the ISID had convinced her. In fact, Stella even believed the ISID when they classified the vase as the most dangerous supernatural object due to the gate to the void it had. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she scrumpled up another page of paper, a strange echo came from the depths of her vase. It wasn&#39;t the sound of the environment or anything in her apartment. It sounded distinct yet quickly faded from her mind. Stella peeped carefully down the hole that led to the eternal abyss, where a voice whispered weakly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s there?&rdquo; Stella shouted back, her voice transcending into the void, making her sound like a god. The voice shot up, terrified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you the one throwing this trash down here?&rdquo; the voice replied angrily. Stella didn&#39;t realise that there had been a living entity residing in her vase. She knew one thing about the void that resided in the vase, and it was the ability to slowly break apart everything that entered. The void was eternally hungry and fed on all matter inside. It was a miracle that Stella had found something alive, trapped in her void.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had been inside the void before with the darkness accepting her and she knew if anyone was to survive in there, it was her. She shook her head in disbelief, recollecting her thoughts before she spoke again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? Why yes, but how did you end up there?&rdquo; Stella replied innocently. She didn&#39;t seem to be concerned as she childishly dropped another piece of junk down the vase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; the voice exclaimed, feeling the sharp paper ball hit his head. &ldquo;What was that for?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So life really exists down there?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! Have you listened to anything I&#39;ve said? You are one of the most stupid humans I&#39;ve ever met! Ugh!&rdquo; the voice exclaimed with fury. Stella wasn&#39;t fussed as she chuckled at the suffering entity stuck in the void. Of course, it wasn&#39;t her problem, she knew she hadn&#39;t trapped anything in the vase in the past 24 hours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I guess I&#39;ll leave you down there to rot then,&rdquo; Stella mocked, toying with her newly blue dyed hair. Of course she had spent money on her own appearance and necessities, but it was in her fashion to treat herself after a long work trip to Japan. She steadily paced away from the vase, strolling towards the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; the voice yelled back agony, piercing the void. &ldquo;I apologise! Please let me out!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella was surprised again by the power the voice had. Something powerful enough to cut through the depth of the void? She knew the void had a thick layer of a strange substance that nullified all sound and light, but with the voice passing this barrier, she became curious. Was this entity truly trapped?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fine, you&#39;re one annoying guy!&rdquo; Stella frowned, tipping the vase over telekinetically. A strange, human-like figure dropped out of the vase onto the wooden floor with a thud. His body was heavily infected by the void, with parts appearing darker than usual. A strange cosmic alert rang in Stella&#39;s mind as she raced away from the fallen figure before he could stand up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I truly thank you dear girl for freeing me from that unbearable dimension&hellip;my cosmic body was somehow still able to be eaten&hellip;&rdquo; the entity thanked. His words were fractured, barely able to put together a sentence. His arms were heavily bruised, with black marks spreading throughout his blood. It wasn&#39;t fatal, but it heavily depleted his physical prowess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella immediately noticed the unforgiving aura the figure was radiating, similar to her cosmic powers. It was infused with a thick stench of raw strength, dripping in a crimson essence. The figure&#39;s naked body, adorned full of tribalistic tattoos, yelled of his barbaric nature and his primitive instincts. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My name is Behatar, and I have come to maintain peace.&rdquo; Behatar explained weakly as he dusted off the void speckles. The black marks began to slowly fade, where oxygen replenished his darkened wounds. His bursting blood veins soothed into a gentle opaque purple, resting back into his skin. &ldquo;What is yours, young lady?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stella&hellip;Stella J&#39;Ning&hellip;&rdquo; Stella replied hazily. She was horrified by his tall and buff physique. His smile was gentle, yet screaming dangerous as it neared Stella. Behatar slicked his hair backwards, dropping his maroon dreads that finally fell freely. Stella inspected him head to toe, terrified and curious of his origin. His almost nude appearance was definitely concerning for Stella since he was only wearing a pair of carbon fiber shorts with a fish scale pattern lining his legs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you going to do&hellip;?&rdquo; Stella asked reluctantly. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This world&hellip;&rdquo; Behatar began menacingly. His tone was slow and structured now, emphasising his words clearly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never sensed so much cosmic energy upon this strange world&hellip;Tell me, what is it with humans? Are you a race destined to thrive?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip;&rdquo; Stella whimpered, still quivering at Behatar&rsquo;s presence &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Behatar is my name, I am the Lord of Strength,&rdquo; Behatar remarked, tapping his chest with pride. &ldquo;You seem like a cosmic girl as well&hellip;are you human?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; Stella replied nervously. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Another mortal wielder of cosmic energy?&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed. &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His voice&#39;s sudden shift to a more frustrated tone signalled to Stella that he was a force not to be reckoned with. In fact, it would be rather dumb to even aggravate him. Stella was terrified as she slowly backed her way away from Behatar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me, are there more of you?&rdquo; Behatar demanded. Stella remained silent, unable to put the right words in her mouth. Behatar&#39;s presence had completely taken over the room with force, his existence overpowering the building. A small and controlled shaking began at the feet of the two, the floor boards creaking ominously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, this won&rsquo;t do! I cannot co-exist with mortals that challenge my power! This world will never have peace if cosmic beings like you exist. My teacher taught me that!&rdquo; Behatar yelled. His explanation was nonsense as Stella listened in confusion, trying to force a smile through her trembling jaw. &ldquo;I don&#39;t want to kill a woman, so I&#39;ll shove you down with your own creation!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella knew for a fact, Behatar was there to kill her for no reason. Stella pounced for her vase, attempting to bottle Behatar back in again. It was the only way she could think of to end his reign of terror. But Behatar&#39;s reflexes were fast, dodging the attempt easily by jumping over her swiping motion at his legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You choose to resist? Very well,&rdquo; Behatar mumbled as he cracked his knuckles. In one fell swoop, Behatar grabbed Stella by the ankle and dangled her in the air like a toy. Her petite body shivered and trembled against the battle-worn hands of Behatar, his grip sending a hellish pain into her spine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella yelled in terror as her head was slowly dunked into her own vase. She couldn&#39;t do anything. In desperation, her frail hands latched onto the sides of the vase, attempting to push herself away from the mouth of the vase. It was no use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As strands of her hair fell in, a gentle rush of demonic wind swept through, directly pulling at her skin. A deathly gravitational force began transporting her into the cold, shadowy void, slowly consuming her alive. Her face slowly disappeared from view with her body still partially above the vase. Behatar grinned and tickled at her exposed skin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Humans,&rdquo; Behatar chuckled. &ldquo;Such strange but beautiful creatures!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella wriggled her legs around as her last resort, attempting to kick Behatar. Of course, it was an insignificant attack as Behatar let go of his grip on Stella as her upper chest was warped to fit the mouth of the vase. Her muffled wails tried to pierce the darkness but to no avail and her squirming only led to a faster demise. &ldquo;Have a thankful death!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The darkness had enveloped her body. Silence. A thud, then crash and drops of blood trickled from an empty space. The hollowness of the void sang to Stella as she slowly sat up, inspecting the small gash near her ankle. Somehow, Behatar had cut her with his own fingernails. Ew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She had been in this position before, sitting alone in her void with nothing to distract her. Behatar&rsquo;s putrid scent? Gone. His fearmongering appearance? Also gone. She knew she was safe as she had entered her own vase before, escaping easily at her own command. But she knew she couldn&#39;t surface. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She knew she would instantly die if she were to resurface due to Behatar&#39;s fearful strength. His presence was overpowering. He hadn&rsquo;t even shown her his true, cosmic abilities. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And at the same time, Stella pondered the question that if she waited, what would happen? Was Behatar going to cause destruction and chaos in the world? Then it struck her like a nail in a coffin. Behatar wasn&#39;t capable of killing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the rest of the day, Stella sat in the darkness the void had offered, thinking. A silent asylum. She was alone and isolated. It was deserving for her, but she knew one thing. She couldn&#39;t give up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she dreamed, the pieces came together perfectly. If Behatar believed cosmic users displaced the Earth&#39;s peace, why did he still resist killing her? His choice wasn&#39;t just sexist, but it fundamentally revealed his greatest weakness, his inability to fight. Perhaps it was his supernatural talent that earned him the title of strength, for now Stella understood he wasn&#39;t a formidable opponent. He was a deceptive, blood type of warrior. A coward on the inside that appeared to look vicious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella regained the motivation needed to come out of her vase, up into the comfort of her home. Tired, exhausted and no longer terrified, she rested upon her bed, not knowing what to do next. Her phone did though, as a vibrant red notification slit the room&rsquo;s desaturated tone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;International Supernatural Intelligence Division, how can we help?&rdquo; the voice beamed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi, it&#39;s Stella J&#39;Ning. Behatar&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been attacked&hellip;&rdquo; Stella explained. Her voice was serious, but a slight hint of her trauma seeped through. &ldquo;Please&hellip;It&#39;s out of control. His powers could be deadly&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you for the report, Aquarius. We&rsquo;ll see if any of the other zodiacs can put a stop to this menace,&rdquo;</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.d4wlde49caay"><span class="c3">VII - Space Goat</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The subtle glow of the Eiffel Tower masked the inky Parisian sky, casting a silhouette that magnified the analogous palette. The radiant sunset glistened romance over the cobblestone streets, sending a gentle breeze that carried the faint scent of fresh bread and blooming jasmine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Inside the elegant restaurant, crystal chandeliers dripped like frozen waterfalls, illuminating tables set with crisp white linen and gleaming silverware. Jasper sat formally beside Lynn, beaming with a cheerful smile. This was a night for indulgence, a night for new experiences. Their first proper date since their last eventful one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The city was still burning bright, embodying its identity of the centre of love, art and fashion, the capital of human nature. Paris was undeniably one of the most attractive cities that architectural marvels stood in, defying laws of time and bending the rules that made humans, humans. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The tourist&#39;s stoic gaze scanned the uneven streets, his expression filled with curiosity. It was a new experience, for he had never seen humans like this ever before. Joined together by what seemed to be a mystical force, even stronger than those of cosmic energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Distant from Jasper and Lynn&#39;s view, the tourist wandered the adjacent streets, nearing their restaurant. He approached a passerby, stopping them attempting to chat casually. &ldquo;Greetings, my name is Ben Hatar,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His voice was gentle but deep, holding a grim undertone to his personality. &ldquo;Do you have any restaurant recommendations?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The passerby shook his head, then pointed meaninglessly at the neon red sign overhead a small storefront. &ldquo;I&#39;m not a big eater, but I really like the quiche that store has. You should try it!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the passerby moved out of his view, Ben trudged towards the store. He had come from the far Western countries of Asia, that of Kathmandu where he wanted to find and experience the true human experience. He wanted to know what it was like to be in the capital of love, art and fashion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His time in Kathmandu alone had disconnected his view from humanity, requiring a much needed trip to see how time has evolved mortals and how they actually behaved in a much more chaotic world. Why did people gather here? What made Paris so special? He had so many questions that were unanswered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But there was something Ben had noticed. Strength differed from Paris than to his home. Instead of strength defined as raw, intrinsic power to conquer challenges, strength not only seemed to differ from each passerby, it felt more collective rather than individual. A link of some sort had connected this strength together into the form of love, hope and passion, something that Ben had never understood. In all, Ben was one of the most powerful men from his home after all, wielding a strong essence that carried a supernatural power. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The store was not populated, in fact it was quite quiet. The displays hummed a quiet static while it preserved the quiche&#39;s heat, allowing them to appear delicious. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll take one of the Quiche Lorraine please,&rdquo; Ben asked, dropping a few coins on the counter. The receptionist handed him the quiche, wrapped in a brown paper bag. It was warm to the touch and fragrant in scent. As he took a bite into the savory treat, it instantly fueled his insatiable hunger. An aromatic bomb had exploded in his mouth, the umami of bacon harmonised perfectly with the melting cream and eggs. A perfect bite of French cuisine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Ben walked down the street, a familiar scent rose from a nearby table. His eyes robotically moved to inspect the scene, where he saw a contemporary, fine and exquisite French restaurant. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi sir, how may I help you?&rdquo; the waiter asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How much does your experience cost?&rdquo; Ben replied, curious of the chattery atmosphere of such an elegant restaurant. The walls were lined with intricate patterns, those that seemed to match the tattoos his tribe had painted onto his body back at home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rather costly sir, average diners spend around &euro;120,&rdquo; the waitress affirmed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&euro;120? For basic needs of food? This is ridiculous! How are you so greedy?&rdquo; Ben yelled, angered at the price. His temper had burst, throwing yet another random fit in public.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn glanced at Ben, standing at the entrance of the restaurant. Their eyes caught each other, then their gaze locked in on each other. Something was terribly wrong. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, two armed security guards rushed through, dragging Ben out of the restaurant to maintain the atmosphere and peace within the restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get your dirty hands off me!&rdquo; Ben yelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, don&#39;t enter this building again. You are disrespecting and disturbing our customers,&rdquo; the guard explained, softening his grip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Disturb and disrespect? You are taking all their money! I&#39;ll take off your heads!&rdquo; Ben yelled, suddenly performing his supernatural talents. His body quickly transformed into a projection of some sort, morphing into the shape of a sickle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fear my tremendous power imbeciles! Taste the power of Behatar, the Jespan Lord of Strength! My mask of Ben Hatar is no more!&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed, swiftly beheading the two guards. Their heads dropped loudly onto the concrete ground with their crimson blood leaking along the sidewalk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Police rushed to the scene and crowds began a relentless panic, causing chaos, disorder and a riot. There, Behatar sat on top of the roof of the ceiling, ripping his human attire off to reveal his naked, tattoo covered body. His ripped cargo pants drooped along with his legs off the side, posing for a bloodthirsty night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper and Lynn jolted up in panic as they rushed outside to see the commotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that&hellip;another cosmic entity?&rdquo; Lynn asked. It had been weeks since they had last encountered a cosmic beast. They were inexperienced back then, but the International Supernatural Intelligence Division had offered them intensive training to help increase their skills in decision making and physical combat. If anyone was to stop Behatar, it was them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar cackled manically, swooping around the streets as he transformed back into his sickle form. Each swipe he performed cut many heads, leaving those who ducked in time miraculously alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You two&hellip;smell different. Cosmic beings, am I right? Granted by the zodiacs&hellip;&rdquo; Behatar grinned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn shook her head in shock. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar grinned even wider, his lips laced in venom. &ldquo;Because I do! You seem Virgo, and the boy&hellip;A GOAT!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper scowled, ready to fight Behatar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll show you a fraction of my power!&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed, now transforming into a chainsaw. Each swing he swung flicked towards the two where they jumped and dodged carefully avoiding damage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was terribly hard, with both sustaining cuts and small gashes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry Jasper, I&#39;ll heal your wounds!&rdquo; Lynn whispered. Her touch regenerated his skin, healing any major scars Behatar had struck on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Restoration based powers? Interesting&hellip;I wonder how it fares with raw destruction!&rdquo; The size of Behatar&#39;s chainsaw grew exponentially with each successful hit. The blade and jaws of the saw became thicker and much deadlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar&#39;s chainsaw form was much scarier than it looked. The roaring buzz it reverberated was deafening, ripping through the skies like a megaphone. It rammed into the ground and the nearby environment up too, destroying countless buildings and the neatly paved roads.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn watched the chainsaw target various objects, finally understanding the homing nature. Before she could explain how Behatar had to target an object and strike it without failure, the chainsaw bolted straight for Jasper again, aiming towards his chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it targeted Jasper and began to home in, the chainsaw started rushing down to deal a strike instead of randomly swinging. Lynn lunged forward intercepting the blow. She quickly restored the crumbled debris into a solid wall, forcing Behatar to strike a different object other than his target, Jasper. The collision and impact forced Behatar back into his original form, where his body tumbled onto the ground, exhausted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Danngit! Now I have to wait anoteher 30 seconds before I can transform again! Stupid ability!&rdquo; Behatar exclaimed, running under cover to hide. His cowardly behaviour immediately alerted Jasper and Lynn who were super cautious of their enemy. Was this his fatal weakness?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; Lynn exclaimed, proud of her theory being correct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Behatar transformed again, this time into a fist moments later, he rushed forwards with a relentless barrage at a much faster speed, slicing open a deep wound on Jasper&#39;s chest. Its power was unmatched, and Jasper saw the contrast was day and night. In his transformed state, his cowardly behaviour was non-existent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jasper!&rdquo; Lynn exclaimed, sprinting over to assist him. She gently pressed her hand on his wound, reversing the state of it and healing the strike. Behatar watched in anger as Lynn treated him with love.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh, I&#39;ve come to slowly hate you humans&hellip;&rdquo; Behatar scoffed. &ldquo;This love or care, or passion even! It&#39;s sickening! It&#39;s nothing like what we Jespans did 2000 years ago!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well that&#39;s 2000 years ago!&rdquo; Jasper exclaimed, standing back up weakly. He stretched his arms and was ready to reengage with the battle. &ldquo;We change unlike you. We aren&#39;t fooled by such simple appearances!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah! I&#39;ve already exploited your targeting system!&rdquo; Lynn yelled, trying to make a point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar dusted off the voice as he pushed Lynn forcefully into the street hard with his fist. &ldquo;Oops. Did I forget to mention that I can retarget midflight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lynn was covered in debris, but unharmed. She wasn&#39;t suffocating but weak enough to not be able to lift the rubble off her chest. She needed a moment to catch her breath, but Jasper was alone. He had to face Behatar on his own, without her. Her heartbeat dropped, worried sick for how Jasper would attack next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Jasper dashed forward with fury driving his legs, aiming to strike Behatar head on. Accepting the head first approach, Behatar changed his form to a greatsword and lunged forward. This time, Jasper firmly grasped the flat edges of the sword with utter precision, preventing it from piercing his skull. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;ll overpower you!&rdquo; Behatar roared, pushing hard. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You haven&#39;t seen my ability yet! This is my raw strength!&rdquo; Jasper laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah? You aren&#39;t as tough as the last few guys I&#39;ve fought! You&#39;re no match!&rdquo; Behatar snickered, his overconfidence coming to the better of himself. Suddenly, his surroundings turned black and he felt his body fall hard on the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">No, this wasn&#39;t reality, nor the void. It felt like that of a pocket dimension, a place where living entities could survive. As he stood up, Jasper&#39;s silhouette shimmered in the distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let&#39;s close this out with a man on man duel, shall we? Let&#39;s swing our dicks around and compare our raw power, eh?&rdquo; Jasper grinned evilly. Behatar&#39;s eyes widened at the mention of a duel. As he tried to transform, there was nothing that came out. His scrawny stance, parallel to his astonished expression of Jasper&#39;s ability suddenly stumbled. For once, he could not exercise his dominance as the Jespan Lord of Strength.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry, but I forgot to mention that this dimension is purely created by the cosmic energy we both possess. In simpler words, our powers are useless in this domain!&rdquo; Jasper snickered, striking first. A devastating kick landed on Behatar&#39;s stomach, sending him flying backwards. He tumbled to the ground where Jasper had already caught up, dealing a strong blow to his legs Behatar failed to dodge again, heavily limiting his movement. He groaned in pain and realised it was lost. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar attempted to fight back but his attempts were futile, Jasper being able to land punches and kicks on him easily. His screams of terror begged for mercy, but Jasper didn&#39;t stop. His ability couldn&#39;t end until one was knocked out. Of course, the domain his ability created was self-sustaining on cosmic energy from both users and without the flow of the energy within one, the dimension was sure to collapse. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Jasper threw in a devastating sledgehammer, it marked Behatar&#39;s defeat as the darkened model of the dimension faded back into the night sky. All his energy had faded away and it was silent as the backdrop glimmered in the shining stars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jasper! You&#39;re alright!&rdquo; Lynn smiled, hugging him tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah, he&#39;s a doofus,&rdquo; Jasper laughed. Behatar laid motionless within the debris he had created. Lynn gripped Jasper&rsquo; arm tightly, a smile peeking through her hopeful expression. There was a moment of relief, but the tension was still lingering in the uneasy air. Jasper knelt down, inspecting Behatar&#39;s frail and fractured body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The quiet rumbling of blades slicing the air entered the conspicuous scene, as bold black and purple branding descended from the air. It was none other than the ISID.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Armed agents jumped out of the helicopter in their military grade vests, weapons slung on their backs as they carefully handled Behatar&#39;s body. They were ready to dispose of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are we clear?&rdquo; the pilot asked in advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. Behatar is out. According to reports, the remaining Jespan Lords include that of Karana and Rukana,&rdquo; an agent reported. His voice was laced in urgency as he signalled for the pilot to take off. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dissolving voices from the helicopter cheered and commended Jasper and Lynn for their brave efforts for defeating Behatar. Their voices spoke of gallantry and wished them a safe night. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing that is so, is so, isn&#39;t it Jasper?&rdquo; Lynn laughed cheekily. The starry night had unfogged the mask of the lord of strength. His facade of power had faded into a cloud of mist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&#39;d thought I&#39;d be exhausted after that one,&rdquo; Jasper sighed, smirking under his relief. Behatar&#39;s presence had officially faded, but only chaos was felt moving forward. Jasper and Lynn weren&#39;t scared for once, and now embraced the future. They knew whatever the force out there was, their friends, their powers of the zodiacs could and would overcome those threats.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.t9u7i2854njh"><span class="c3">VIII - Stormbow</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Riyadh&#39;s modernisation is a testament to contemporary architecture, breaking all laws of reality. Ever since its citywide plans to advance throughout the 1940s, the city only grew exponentially, with fluctuations that spiked their growth not only in wealth, but also advancements in technology and life. Riyadh was more than just a desert miracle. For an ancient Middle-Eastern city to undergo such dramatic changes to now a futuristic city with ultramodern landscapes, history was buried beneath technology.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Riyadh shimmered like a mirage, caught between the desert memory and steel ambition. Under the surrounding grainy desert that stretched for miles was the ancient city, buried deep into the now hidden roots of Riyadh. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was no surprise that the days were extremely warm, the arid heat of the city would beam upon the buildings that cast a natural glow under the sunlight. It had been weeks since Samir&rsquo;s last cosmic encounter and this was the few days he had time off. He had been training meticulously on his control of his supernatural talents. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir was named the Sagittarius Zodiac, with his notable ability to adapt and conquer any new obstacles. He was dedicated, for he was granted the cosmic arrow. It shed through the sky, able to pass through objects like a ghost. He was certainly creative on how he was able to puppet his arrow, making it perform near impossible tricks to eliminate or suppress threats. Most of all, nobody could challenge his machine like precision, for his aim was perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The International Supernatural Intelligence Division had trained and helped Samir within the past few days, aiding him in his journey of self-improvement. Funds especially were important to Samir as he had moved to Riyadh only recently, having come from the war torn town of Arada in UAE. It was completely torn down, leaving nothing but desert. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir often had caught himself reminiscing of his home, and how no traces were left. Everything was wiped off the map and officials had taken the land. In Riyadh, Samir knew that he had to change as a person. Of course, being quite mutable, he accepted the task of helping the city just like if he were to protect his true home Arada. It meant serving with courage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The city was packed with tourists from all over the world, creating a diverse atmosphere within the air space. One particular tourist had a scornful remorse against the city&rsquo;s architecture though, and he rejected the advancements through his voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are stripping away history! You have covered this rich, culturally varied desert in this monotone and disgusting facade that does nothing but appear impressive!&rdquo; the man yelled. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man did in fact, speak of facts, for Riyadh used to be named Hajr, an ancient and simple town full and rich of culture. Now, the city was a technology bomb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You pave deserts with glass and call it progress,&rdquo; the man snarled, his voice bending across the street like an echo from every direction at once. His cloak flared as if tugged by invisible tides. &ldquo;You poison the oceans, set the sky on fire with your machines, and then congratulate yourselves for your skyscrapers. Do you not feel ashamed, humans?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! Watch where ya walkin&rsquo;!&rdquo; residents exclaimed, annoyed at the behaviour of the tourist. His antics were heroic in a way, but also frustrating to the crowd. As Samir crossed the road to reach the shop that he had yearned for, Starbucks, he bumped into the strange, cloaked tourist. The same tourist that was disparaging the wonderful city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have eyes, good sir?&rdquo; the tourist yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir stopped for a moment, but was still carried away by the wave of people that were also crossing with him. For a moment, a strange cosmic signal sliced his mind, ringing alarms that yelled of a powerful discrepancy in the air. But Samir continued forward. He had a different mind in goal, he was destined to first try a Frappucino from Starbucks, a cold, relaxing drink that would help with the heat. It was his friend&rsquo;s suggestion, and Samir was curious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he sipped away on his newly purchased drink, Samir headed back onto the streets, this time met with the eyes of the same tourist across the road. Had he been following him? There was an unsettling tension that wasn&rsquo;t resolved. It only grew by the second, until it was finally broken when the traffic lights blinked green. The tourist approached Samir, ready to lecture him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir was skeptical of the dirty and ragged cloak the tourist had worn and backed away. The tourist leaned in, and instead of yelling in Samir&rsquo;s face, inspected his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met you&hellip;have I? You reek of space dust&hellip;&rdquo; the tourist grumbled grumpily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, who are you?&rdquo; Samir stuttered, readying his arrow from behind. He wasn&rsquo;t hesitant to threaten the tourist as he believed the tourist was violating multiple laws by acting this way towards him. He was inconspicuously close to him, his breath breathing on his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir reluctantly pushed the tourist away from him, heaving him to the ground. The tourist was astonished by Samir&rsquo;s actions, his expression immediately turning angry. Samir didn&rsquo;t want to take any chances of this interaction escalating into a fight, so he used his arrow without hesitation on the tourist. A quick hit with the tail end of the arrow on the head, and the tourist fell forwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You dare challenge me youngling?&rdquo; the tourist grumbled. &ldquo;Do you know who I am? I&rsquo;m already frustrated with how humans have wrecked this Earth! Have you seen climate change and a terrible crisis happening? And you wish to eliminate someone who cares about this planet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;ll believe you!&rdquo; Samir laughed, walking away in disrespect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you&hellip;Do not mess with me, Karana the Lord of Space!&rdquo; Karana exclaimed, jumping up from the ground ecstatically. The ground sank like liquid, as if reality had been warped. Citizens cried, causing chaos amidst Karana&rsquo;s awakening. He landed on top of a building, showcasing his inhuman mobility and spatial manipulation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His fingers splayed and thus the world folded in response. Spikes twirled out from the ground as surfaces bent to form the jagged angles, scaring passerbys. &ldquo;You don&#39;t recognise the consequences of your actions, eh? I&#39;ve lived for 2000 years and I&#39;ve had my ways!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll shoot you down!&rdquo; Samir scoffed, firing away his distinct cosmic arrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana weaved around the arrow, distorting his body to perfectly avoid the arrow&#39;s collision with his body. It never came close, unable to hit his warped form. His body contoured in impossible ways that Samir couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you done toying with me?&rdquo; Karana mocked, sighing in disbelief. Samir stood strong and held his ground. He was frustrated, annoyed at himself. His enemy could manipulate reality, yet his arrow could phase through reality itself. Why could he not beat him? It was a simple yet arduous task. Samir spat, readying his stance. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He spatially guided his arrow back around, reading Karana&rsquo;s every movement. He had the sightline advantages. Behind the uneven slosh of walls the liquified ground had formed, Samir navigated the arrow through the solid objects, planning a surprise attack on Karana. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; Karana exclaimed, throwing a swinging wave towards Samir that oscillated back and forth. It rocked through the ground and violently displaced Samir, throwing him up into the air and landing back into the ground with a loud crash. Karana saw Samir for a brief moment and knew exactly where he was. &ldquo;I see you now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana leapt backwards, into a better position to ready his next attack. However, Samir&#39;s arrow still struck Karana from behind. Each of them had traded blows, with each individual still strong enough to continue. The streets of Riyadh were now completely transformed, streets had surged upwards with buildings collapsing in on themselves. The scene was nightmarish to say the least, as roads were blocked off, causing absolute public chaos. The roar of innocent citizens being hurt drowned Samir, speeding up his heartbeat. He didn&rsquo;t know if this disruption in reality was temporary or permanent, but one thing he knew was that he couldn&rsquo;t give up. Karana was his enemy here. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your youth truly shows your inexperience&hellip;&rdquo; Karana began. He had positioned himself out of Samir&#39;s sight, hidden behind a building to avoid his arrow. He knew that as long as Samir couldn&#39;t see him, he couldn&#39;t attack. But Karana could with his spatial manipulation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shut up old man!&rdquo; Samir exclaimed, concentrating harder as he entered his arrow&#39;s vision. He needed to find Karana quickly as he was still vulnerable to his attacks. As he phased through a solid wall, the arrow didn&#39;t seem to exit. The wall seemed to go infinitely deep. What was wrong? Samir suddenly turned the arrow right, exiting the object. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was too late. Samir felt a thick metallic surface hit his back hard, knocking him out of his state losing control of his arrow. He tumbled to the ground with a dramatic thud as he gazed up, seeing the extruded metallic surface as the source of his defeat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Stop trying to challenge me. You&#39;re wasting your time,&rdquo; Karana scoffed, leaning over Samir&rsquo;s broken form. His body was weak, unable to move as Karana rudely tranced off leaving him to die. It was only appropriate to, since Samir had done the same with him before. With a dismissive sneer, Karana spat his blood on the permanently scarred and ravaged city. &ldquo;Maybe you will stand a chance in 100 years, but until then, I </span><span class="c4">win</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir laid on the ground motionless, until the subtle slicing of air gradually rang in his ears. It wasn&rsquo;t the public anymore, special forces had come in to attempt to fix the mess. It was Samir&rsquo;s worst nightmare, the distortions didn&rsquo;t revert. Karana had permanently ruined the city of Riyadh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;International Supernatural Intelligence Division coming in hot!&rdquo; agents exclaimed as they landed in the city. The men in black and purple vests rushed around the crazed landscape, aiding any individuals who got caught in the cross fire. Samir was majorly injured, but not dead. A once-busy plaza now resembled a deformed photograph, its buildings strung into weird, inorganic shapes. Sirens wailed, not just from ISID agents but from every emergency service in the city. Samir, half-conscious on the rubble, felt the weight of failure press heavier than his wounds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Samir!&rdquo; an agent yelled. &ldquo;Are you alright? Who was that?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir weakly groaned, sighing with relief. &ldquo;That was&hellip;Karana&hellip;One of the Jespan Lords you had mentioned&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The agent&rsquo;s expression widened, eyes almost bulging out. &ldquo;You mean&hellip;that monster? The one that can rewrite reality?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You got eyes?&rdquo; Samir scowled, frustrated at the agent&rsquo;s lack of observation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir, we got an emergency level threat. We need to dispatch our strongest members. Karana might still be lurking in the city,&rdquo; the agent reported through her radio device. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll mitigate him,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Samir was transported to the Division&rsquo;s special medical bay, he heard explosions. Loud, nuclear-like explosions. It had to be her. If Samir knew anything, the only way one could beat that monster was to physically destroy the reality he wrote. And she was the perfect person to do just that.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.6v1cl8eqbjul"><span class="c3">IX - Detonation Devastation</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Riyadh was in flames. An eruption of chaos followed the shifting landscape of the city, with buildings warped, flowing outwards dramatically. There had been a battle with supernatural wits thrown into the mix.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devastating cries of innocents and wailing sirens filled the air, as emergency services rushed across the city in a hurry. It was calm before the storm, and chaos after. Nobody was safe. Especially when he was out there. There was no sense of urgency, instead a complete sense of panic and disorganisation. Every action, every movement was actively trailed by the fluid flowing buildings that began to govern the city. Unspeakable shapes were forming on the brink of sight, shadows thus engulfing the city into complete darkness. Nothing was, was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The International Supernatural Intelligence Division had been actively monitoring the city for the past hours, trying everything in their ability to suppress the terrorism happening. Nothing budged, even with their technology. All they knew was that it was a cosmic entity that was disrupting the natural flow of reality, bending the city into a complete, nightmarish experience. Their supernatural agents? Most of them were too far away, except for Cindi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi&#39;s home was Riyadh, but she had spent the previous weeks inside the ISID&#39;s newly constructed lab in Khurais, Saudi Arabia. She was training to become stronger and fiercer. Unlike most others, Cindi was hot headed, direct and stubborn. Her will was unbreakable and her strength was unmatched. Cindi, the depiction of the Aries Zodiac, was one of the most dangerous Zodiac users among the ISID. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Cindi, we&#39;ve got reports in Riyadh that you might want to see,&quot; Agent Noura explained. She had a clipboard in hand, holding a stern expression that conveyed formal business. &quot;It&#39;s an urgent matter,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Tell me!&quot; Cindi replied, quickly disbanding her training session. She swiftly unwrapped her hand straps used for her combat practice, turning her attention to the worried agent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Our agents are down, and Riyadh is still being terrorised by some unknown entity. We&#39;ve gotten reports to suggest it might be another Jespan Lord, but we are not sure,&quot; Agent Noura continued, her voice now drooping even lower. Her concerned gaze struck Cindi like a deer in the headlights, sending a slight panic down her spine. She jolted upwards, shocked by the news.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Riyadh? You mean my home is being terrorised?&quot; Cindi asked, confirming the devastation factor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes. You&#39;re one of our last agents that may be able to defeat him in time before the city is transformed, and even worse, possibly even consumed!&quot; Agent Noura exclaimed. This time, an unsettling and sickening sensation struck Cindi. If she lost her home, what was left of her? She&#39;d have no purpose. Her parents had died just recently and without anything to protect, she felt like there was no reason to keep fighting with her powers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll go, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Cindi assured, walking towards the front gate. &quot;Can you give me a ride?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Sure, keep this ear piece on so we can communicate,&quot; Agent Noura suggested, leading her to specialised ISID vehicles parked out front of the laboratory. The engine throttled, spitting out a loud roar as it sped through the Arabian desert towards Riyadh. Sand splattered across the barren landscape and grains flew along the windows of their vehicle. Cindi was brewing in anger and excitement, finally being able to unleash her fury. It had been a while since she had last used her abilities and it felt undeniably terrifying and exciting. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi approached the pillaring walls that bended inwards, casting an elongated shape that formed some-what of a dome that had trapped the city. It was messy, each step stepping in the rubble or debris. Agent Noura&#39;s vehicle fired off, back to the laboratory as Cindi ventured deeper into the winding city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The buildings that outlined the city had bent inwards, trapping anything from leaving. Cindi walked bravely forwards, using her abilities to travel through unharmed. She wasn&#39;t afraid of anything, her indomitable march forward sent everything that faced her into oblivion. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cindi O&#39;luron, status?&rdquo; the agent&#39;s voice rang through the ear piece.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Terrible, is the base safe?&rdquo; Cindi asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t worry about us. We&#39;re miles away from the city. Focus on the task at hand. Can you find him?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t know what he looks like, but I&#39;ll try,&rdquo; Cindi replied, sprinting around the city. It was slowly becoming more and more deformed by the minute, the towering skyscrapers began to appear collapsing from where Cindi stood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As chunks and panels fell, Cindi performed her ability to destroy the junk that fell. She was able to detonate herself like a bomb, creating miniature explosions where her body was positioned. More importantly, the size and power of her explosions represented that of her anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her explosion wiped away the debris that surrounded her, helping her carve a path through the distortion. It felt only natural for Cindi to use her powers to clean up the mess for whoever created it. But it felt also wrong as each explosion also consumed parts of the city. The extruding buildings that barricaded the streets? She had blown up for trapped citizens to escape. What she had to protect had to be destroyed to be protected. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The philosophical approach to the issue was rather intriguing, but Cindi had given up pondering that thought. If she even began to overthink the task at hand, she would be distracted and unfocused, costing her the mission. After all, it was her task to suppress the enemy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As she cleared more of the uneven terrain, the city felt even more silent. It had become a labyrinth of darkness, the towering skyscrapers casting horrifying shadows that engulfed most of the city. Cindi felt isolated with the sunlight barely able to creep in through the cracks between the buildings overhead. She was alone, afraid and most importantly, attentive to her surroundings. She could not let the enemy surprise her. She had to find him first to gain the advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; a voice grunted, alerting Cindi. &ldquo;You are destroying the city&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Backing away from the figure that was masked by the silver shapes, Cindi choked on her words. &ldquo;Who are you? Why have you done this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t this your city? Why would you destroy it?&rdquo; The voice continued, pondering philosophical questions. Cindi didn&#39;t want to play the mysterious man&#39;s mind games, so she detonated herself again, revealing his bulky figure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Cindi replied, her eyes widening in anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man scoffed, crossing his arms. &ldquo;Fool! You have the brain of a baby!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nobody!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Silence girl! I am Karana, the Lord of Space. Let my divine land extend for ages to come!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Frustration hung heavy in the air as Karana traded glances among the raging eyes of Cindi&#39;s, indulging in the flames that burst within. Such fiery passion, such strong drive. Cindi dashed forward, attempting to attack Karana directly first. Karana needed only that of a small movement to dodge her heavy attack, simply escaping. Without hesitation, Karana restrained Cindi with the ground, extending the thick concrete to wrap around her fragile body. Gravity weighed upon her as an overwhelmingly strong pressure sat on her back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Agh!&rdquo; Cindi yelled, squirming. In desperation, she detonated herself to free her from the Earth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going down without a proper fight!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A tense pursuit enraged among the two maniacal tyrants that destroyed the city. Step after step and jump after jump, another intersection was blocked by new rubble, just for a deafening explosion to further mess up the clean roads of Riyadh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each explosion thrusted Cindi closer to Karana, but his spatial manipulation outpaced her effective explosion cooldown. She was getting exhausted already since her explosions drained her energy significantly. Her explosions just weren&#39;t enough. It only destroyed more of the warped city, leaving Karana unharmed. Though Karana did resort to creating a small shield from warped debris, Cindi knew his weakness. She had to get close. She only felt that she had one last detonation within her before she collapsed from exhaustion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You know? I don&#39;t want to fight any of you. I&#39;m only here because your friend started it!&rdquo; Karana tried to argue. He was aware of his situation and Cindi&#39;s power, so he made a run for it. Each step he took, each footstep that landed on the ground destabilised reality around him, distorting the ground and extruding humongous pillars from them. He was creating a maze with each step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi leapt through the jagged walls and fractured ground, trying to find Karana through his dynamic maze. If she was able to create a close detonation, Karana would die for good. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi&#39;s pursuit of Karana spanned across the whole city, weaving through various buildings and around its bent shapes. None of the changes had reverted and Cindi began to panic at the fact these scars were permanent. She didn&#39;t want her city to look this ugly. It was her home, after all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Each and every twist and skew of the surroundings only made navigating harder for Cindi. Every time Cindi tried to leap up and grab Karana was futile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Argh! I&#39;m not going to let you go this easily!&rdquo; Cindi yelled, detonating herself. The nearby area crumbled away as her explosions broke away the distorted world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana was close, and Cindi had finally caught up to him. Karana, too absorbed at rebuilding the city, still didn&#39;t notice Cindi&#39;s cosmic signal from behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi detonated again, this time using her explosion to jump, beginning her attack plan. Karana&#39;s attention turned to the sound of the nearby explosion, now finally noticing Cindi&#39;s true capabilities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Cindi thrusted herself into the air as Karana extruded another pillar beneath her. She hung in the sky, ready to pounce onto Karana. As she descended, Karana calculated her next move, preparing to push her away with a nearby building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get away from me!&rdquo; Karana yelled, his voice filled with fear. Karana perfectly understood the circumstances of his situation and knew whatever he did, couldn&#39;t let the explosion connect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But he couldn&#39;t. Cindi had detonated early, bewildering Karana. For a split second, Karana flinched, causing him to inaccurately shape the space around him. Instead, an intricate metal beam thrust into his back instead of moving Cindi away, pushing him into Cindi&#39;s detonation zone. With the momentum already gained from the beam&#39;s force, instead of blowing up into pieces, Karana was sent flying out of the country to a different place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His scream cut through the air, his body bypassing his own creations. But still, the city remained broken. For Cindi, her eyes snapped shut, her body becoming numb. She had overused her abilities and was completely tired out. Her body fell through the air, plummeting towards the ground. There was nobody in sight, and all she could feel was the hot air trailing her, weaving through each strand of her sienna hair.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It felt like a moment before Cindi opened her weak eyes, seeing the broken and displaced city. She felt blood trickle down her face, and a sharp pain in her waist. It was a miracle she had survived, with what seemed to be a few injuries. The sound of men shouting echoed through the torn terrain and ragged streets, alarming Cindi of rescue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cindi! Are you there?&rdquo; her ear piece buzzed. She completely forgot it was lodged in her ear, and the fact it was still intact was mindblowing. Though she could feel the earpiece had sustained damage through the low, static audio, she smiled. &ldquo;Cindi!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;?&rdquo; Cindi replied weakly, admitting her loss. She had failed to defeat Karana. Her sole purpose was to protect her home, but now it was ripped up and shaped into something that formed a nightmare.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is Karana dead?&rdquo; the agent&#39;s voice beamed through the ear piece.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo; Cindi hesitated, her voice dropping in confidence. The agent&#39;s silent response yelled frustration and disappointment within the organisation. &ldquo;I sent him&hellip;away&hellip;I don&#39;t know where&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, we can&#39;t do much. Until we get an approximate whereabouts, you need to stay in place,&rdquo; the agent began. Cindi responded nervously with a simple yes, then took her ear piece out. She had done what she could have and nothing more. Was it fate that decided this? It couldn&rsquo;t have. She had to believe that if anyone was actually going to properly beat Karana was the one who could also rewrite reality. It was a clash of forces.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.vu9tteh4ehl8"><span class="c3">X - The Rule of the Lion</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The eternal bell ruptured the morning stillness, harbouring the church&rsquo;s solemn call. The biting Baltic wind whipped through the cobblestone streets of Tallinn&#39;s Old Town, now weaving through the intricate fabled architecture the town offered. Tallinn was an extraordinary place, a point of history and identity that defined Medieval Europe. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam stood alone in the town centre, reminiscing about his stepfather&rsquo;s death. It had been a few weeks since the incident occurred, where his stepfather was attacked by an armed thief, killing him. Sam was alone, he never had true parents. His biological parents had passed away a long time ago, and his stepfather had taken care of him ever since.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it was natural for Sam to follow his stepfather&rsquo;s advice. He was a police officer and he had morals, convictions and beliefs on what life was. He had an ethos that governed his perspective on reality, and Sam had to uphold this. It sounded relevant to him, especially when he had encountered a supernatural being only days ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He recalled teaming up with his new friends, working together to overcome the overwhelming cosmic force that had breathed upon them. Even so, Sam was alone this time. He was back home, with no one to talk to. His parents were already dead, and the only thing that Sam had begun to care for was his home, Tallinn. It wasn&rsquo;t in his best motives to come home, but it felt like a duty, a legacy to preserve and for the greater history. In the end, Tallinn was a cornerstone of Estonia&rsquo;s rich history and diverse culture. He couldn&rsquo;t let another cosmic force threaten his home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His nightly duty didn&#39;t reach the far edges of the town where it bordered the Tallinn Bay, for that area was always alert with boats cruising through the thin strip of water that led out to sea and into the Gulf of Finland. Sam had always assumed that the sea acted as a natural barrier, blocking any forces out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">What many failed to notice in the deep waters, especially Sam who was skeptical of the sea as an entry point, was an entity, traversing the sea bed. It was nothing Sam nor any of the residents had ever seen, with each step forward on the sea bed vibrating the ground. It felt like strange, sudden spikes that subtly surged from beneath from the surface. Nobody drew attention, throwing the miniscule trembles off as a mere inconvenience of uneven pavement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was in fact a cosmic energy surge. His cosmic presence radiated yellow, warping the liquid surrounding him into the shape of his own body, creating a thin layer of air between the user and the sea. He couldn&rsquo;t drown, for his unique abilities allowed him to adapt in so many scenarios, bending rules of reality that no human could ever imagine. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the entity crept upon the docks of Tallinn, nearby citizens noticed his scrawny figure. He looked terrible, with nothing but a pair of shorts. His body was bare, but unlike most homeless people, the figure who stood at the end of the pier didn&rsquo;t have tattoos, or any marks that made him recognisable as a homeless, drunk or crazy man. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He appeared as an ordinary Joe, black hair, black eyes, average height but underwhelmingly skinny. Locals made note of him and his arrival drew the attention of news outlets, documenting the strange phenomenon. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you alright sir?&rdquo; some asked, concerned of his state. Was he starved? How did he end up in the cold ocean? Many gathered around, but not Sam.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry, but I&rsquo;m home at last,&rdquo; the figure explained, walking through the town square with a towel wrapped around his body. Locals donated extra clothes, showing their generosity to the man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; another asked, curious for more information of the man&rsquo;s mysterious history. &ldquo;Is Tallinn your home?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Call me Kardo, for Estonia is my home,&rdquo; Kardo proclaimed. His slow gaze upon the happy and cheerful citizens drew a smile to his face, believing they were there to appraise him. Of course, he knew he was of a higher status than them. He was of another race after all, but no one could tell. Jespans looked too similar to humans, apart from the increased melanin that would rarely expose them. Most people didn&rsquo;t care much about this as dyes were common to change hair colours and accepted Kardo as a respected member of Tallinn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His careful stroll through the streets of Tallinn significantly changed his mood, for his reaction to be mixed. He was pleasantly surprised by how much had changed, but was also disappointed at how the humans had transformed his land into a center of community and gathering. He didn&rsquo;t disparage the fact it was terrible looking, but something that strayed too far from his vision. Kardo had envisioned for something more grand, more elegant that captured the essence of the land he had created.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">While Kardo was touring the town, visiting the creations the humans had built, Sam was busy. With Kardo praising some creations and criticising others, Sam was thrown into an emergency call, requesting him for a mission. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Like others, Sam was also part of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division due to his powers, embodying the zodiac of Leo. Like others, he had trained for the past few days, improving his strategy and battle knowledge. But this was his first time deploying as a singular unit. His very first mission. It sounded impossible at first, but Sam was confident that he would find a way through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reality bender&hellip;&rdquo; the agent announced, her voice in a slight panic. It was evident by her tone that this entity of some sort had affected other countries to say the least, causing international chaos. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re our last hope since you rewrite reality as well,&rdquo; the agent explained, her voice now slowing down dramatically. &ldquo;Please, do it for us,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let you down,&rdquo; Sam assured, hanging up the phone confidently. He slung on his carnival mask, an accessory that reminded him of his family. He wore it as if it meant the world to him, as he had obtained the mask when he went to a carnival when he was younger, when his biological parents were still alive. His stepdad had explained its significance, giving Sam something to fight for other than himself and his home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam leapt outside, making his way down through the city. He noticed strange alterations of buildings, with walls bending strangely. He was confused on how it was done, and intrigued, he inspected the now curved shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo; a voice beamed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam jumped backwards, scared by the man&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the man asked back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m Samuel Paike. Can you answer my question now?&rdquo; Sam asked, walking out into a more exposed area of the city.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me? You can call me Karana, the Lord of Space, I&#39;m of cosmic descent unlike you humans,&rdquo; Karana explained. &ldquo;This part of town looks rather grim, not to my liking. Did you do this?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. History did,&rdquo; Sam explained. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I rewrite history! Let this area take the form of my vision!&rdquo; Karana exclaimed, motioning with his fingers. Each movement swayed the landscape significantly, turning the shapes of the rustic and vintage buildings into strange, fluid ones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In one motion, Karana had transformed the nearby buildings into organic, free flowing buildings that had now defied reality. Indeed did his creations look significantly better than the original, giving almost that of life and vibrancy to the existing architecture, Sam knew that the man was toying with history and his home. He never wanted anyone to threaten or disturb the landscape, and a deadly tension rose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam felt a strange sensation enter his body suddenly, giving him a premonition of Karana&rsquo;s true power. They could both rewrite how reality would play out. But they were also different in a sense. Sam&rsquo;s ability was more mental, while Karana&rsquo;s was physical, showing a clear division and control of power. Sam maintained a stoic expression, not letting his fear overwhelm him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you, child?&rdquo; Karana asked. &ldquo;You emit that of the cosmic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam smiled in excitement. &ldquo;Of the supernatural, of course. I can create rules that bestow calamity upon my targets!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He wasn&rsquo;t afraid to expose his abilities, as his ability was quite confusing to understand. It was a concept that not many understood well, and he believed that even stating it out, his enemies still stood no chance. He was stubborn to say the least and his power was his pride. He emphasised it to anyone and anything that stood in his way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The ground rippled like water, then a wave swept the nearby cars away. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana followed his actions with another sudden surge, trapping Sam in a cage built from the extruded landscape. Karana hissed, wrapping around the cage with his body. &ldquo;Your power lingers bitter&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fear me! My rule goes forth, let all actions be reversed upon him from now on!&rdquo; Sam exclaimed, speaking courageously. The walls snapped downwards, each support beam swirling and twirling back down into the ground. As they reverted, the recoil frailed randomly, hitting Karana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ow! So you can bend reality, just like me huh? I&#39;m not a fan of outward appearances!&rdquo; Karana yelled, stretching a piece of land beneath Sam. This time, there wasn&#39;t a planned shape, instead Karana relied on the recoil damage. The moment Karana defined the shape, it snapped back violently, hitting Sam hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Fool! Make no mistake! I have more experience than you, for I have lived 2000 years! I understand reality more than you!&rdquo; Karana exclaimed. &ldquo;Your youth makes you so idealistic, blurring your sight on what is in front of you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sam gasped, unable to catch his breath. Karana laced together a chain of attacks, bending Sam&#39;s own rules against him. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&#39;t want to waste my time,&rdquo; Karana began. His expression beamed nervously towards the beaten up Sam. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana lifted another piece of the ground up, using its snapping force to sling himself away from the scene. Karana was long gone when Samuel finally caught his breath, standing among the chaos Karana had created. His home, his town was distorted, warped from its origins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam, still with a scornful taste in his mouth knew he could not let this cosmic entity terrorise any more towns anymore. Even if his powers were restricted to an extent, he knew Karana could still be a dangerous threat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Sam followed an estimated path that reflected the trajectory of the launch Karana had taken, he found himself in the small town of Kohila. There, he found Karana alone, vulnerable and exposed. He surprisingly wasn&#39;t causing any trouble, and Sam was quite surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why do you follow me? I don&#39;t want to kill you boy!&rdquo; Karana exclaimed, thrusting spikes out of the ground. Sam quickly dodged them and followed Karana. Karana desperately needed to maintain distance, using Sam&#39;s rule to his advantage. He flung himself onto the rooftops, giving him the highground advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are you here?&rdquo; Sam yelled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because, before my slumber 2000 years ago, I was the founder of this land! This is my home! Before, the area between Latvia and Russia was all sea, until I came and terraformed this place! Be grateful for what I have done! You humans have ruined my natural serenity!&rdquo; Karana explained. &ldquo;I want to enjoy and see what history has written&hellip;But you! You and others have </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Karana again, sent forward a sinusoidal wave that rocked the ground violently. Sam waited for the wave to repel backwards, realising the power of the rule he had created. He wasn&#39;t thinking creatively enough and realised the only method to beat Karana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the wave crept behind Sam, he let the ground swing him up into the sky like a basketball in motion. The ground had perfectly slung him with the trajectory aimed for Karana. Completely unaware, Karana looked desperately for Sam&#39;s whereabouts. He had vanished somehow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karana!&rdquo; Sam yelled as he descended through the air. Karana watched Sam in disbelief as he plunged from the sky. He had used his own powers against him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Karana panicked, trying to push away his body by warping his structure. As he forced Sam&#39;s plummeting fist away through warping, he realised what was about to happen. Every warp he had just performed vigorously snapped backwards, and with the pressure of gravity weighing on Sam, his body fell backwards. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he fell and acted in desperation, Karana attempted to stretch his body out into paper thickness, trying to slow his descent for a safer landing. Of course, his attempt was futile, snapping back and only falling even faster. As gravity acted on Karana, his body landed on thick, barbed fences, penetrating his organs and ripping his body out. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam had tumbled onto the rooftop safely. Peeking past the edge, the grotesque scene reeked of blood. It was pure chaos, but reality was restored. Suddenly, with the last of Karana&rsquo;s energy, his finger thrusted upwards in the air, grazing Sam&rsquo;s face and cutting a small wound. Blood rushed out, the injury only minor. His finger snapped back, cutting him again. It wasn&rsquo;t painful, rather it burnt for a split second that lingered with electricity that numbed the pain. He was amazed by what Karana could do. He even doubted the fact that he didn&rsquo;t want to kill him. Such a strange man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The metallic spikes and wires had completely burnt parts of Karana&rsquo;s skin, the electrocution visible. It was only then Samir noticed the fence was also electrical. It had explained his almost instant death, with a disturbing taste left in his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Samir took his now sweaty mask off and jumped down from the building as a helicopter came from overhead, descending and landing on a small patch of grass. Exhausted, he fell backwards onto the soft, green grass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good work Sam,&rdquo; the agent&#39;s voice beamed. Men followed closely behind, rushing to dispatch Karana&#39;s wrangled body. He had been finally defeated. &ldquo;Another Jespan Lord down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sam sighed a sigh of relief, though still unhappy of how he let Karana destroy many cities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it permanent?&rdquo; Sam asked, exhausted. &ldquo;The damage&hellip;he dealt on my city?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, multiple cities have been affected. You&rsquo;re not the only one. We&rsquo;ve got our best agents working on finding a solution,&rdquo; the agent assured. Sometimes, it wasn&rsquo;t as it had seemed. Sam didn&rsquo;t realise the true danger of Karana. He had grazed his surface, suppressing his rule of reality. Had he rewritten reality already? His rules were certain, but his attitude was not. Sam laid on the grass, without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Say, is reality governed by our beliefs or actions?&rdquo; Sam asked philosophically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The agent swung her blonde hair around, meeting Sam&rsquo;s gaze again. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s up to interpretation in my opinion. You need a dream to start somewhere, and without one, reality won&rsquo;t be the same,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her words rang deep in Sam, circulating his mind. What was to come? As he pondered among his thoughts that drifted through the air, all that there was left inside his body was a raging desire to show his true potential. He closed his eyes under the warm sunlight, laying down on the grass. Birds chirped a melodic tune, the surrounding ambience calming his inner-state. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was more to come,&rdquo; he thought. Change was imminent, and for a moment everything seemed to go silent. An uneasy feeling told him that there was still a larger cosmic force approaching. One of the greatest, and strongest auras he had ever felt. But it was for such a brief moment. He couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that time had skipped a beat.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.copuxen5er9w"><span class="c9">XI - To Do It</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The grand halls, adorned with cascading metallic ribbons and sculptures that twisted toward infinity, welcomed the next elected Lord into the party. It was extravagant, luxurious and formal, yet the ceremony itself consisted of nothing more than the candidate walking through seven identical gold framed doorways in sequence, each one slightly smaller than the last, until they emerged onto the manor&rsquo;s exquisite balcony that loomed over the town square. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The assembled crowd watched from beneath, chanting his name. Each chant grew louder as he stepped through the doors, adding to the tension and unwavering silence. The last member of the Jespan High Party was chosen. Being a Jespan Lord in Ajespa was a big deal as it meant for an individual to undergo a tedious process, needing to prove themselves worthy by imbuing their bodies with a special orichalcum crystal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Ajespa was a planet not far from Earth, with it only being 100 million kilometers away nearing Venus. Having a more ragged landscape from the insanely mountainous continents, the planet was rich in Orichalcum. Rukana stepped forward onto the balcony, clearing his throat before he began. This was the moment that he had dreamt of, becoming a leader to his people. He had a voice now, ascended above many, finally able to climb the ladder of succession.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you! My name is Rukana, and I will be your fourth and last Jespan Lord!&rdquo; Rukana announced, the crowd cheering. It felt unreal, his journey to this position was brutal for he had to overcome many challenges. His sandy hair brushed against the soft wind, flowing along time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The golden doorways behind him seemed to shimmer in approval, their diminishing sizes now representing not the crushing weight of responsibility, but the focused clarity that came with accepting one&#39;s place in the vast, crystalline network of Ajespan governance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you all for coming,&rdquo; the governing lord Behatar declared, revealing himself to the crowd. His tall figure and black cloak hinted at his authority, silencing the noisy crowd. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please congratulate your newest Lord, Rukana again!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crowd roared in applause again, celebrating the feat. Rukana shyly smiled, feeling Behatar&rsquo;s firm hand on his shoulder. Behatar guided Rukana back through the golden gates, into a different room adorned with Orichalcum. The immense power radiated from the orichalcum had already established the presence of the body inside as Rukana guessed it was their queen, Lucina. Though Rukana was nervous, he took a deep breath before he stepped into the room, where Lucina sat quietly at her desk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The back of the chair swivelled around to reveal the queen Lucina, displaying her beauty and wisdom. She sat lazily, flaunting her extravagant jewellery and viscous pink braids for her hair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rukana&hellip;Tell me&hellip;Now that you&rsquo;re a lord, what do you plan to do?&rdquo; Lucina asked, inspecting her nails.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana looked at Lucina emptily, lost in words. Indeed was Lucina their queen, she was also the Lord of Wisdom. She knew a lot of things and Rukana was afraid that she would pass his ambitions off as nothing. Was telling the truth too risky? Or did Lucina already know from her wisdom who Rukana was and his motivations? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I have a dream&hellip;A dream of hope&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina coughed, interrupting Rukana. &ldquo;A dream you say? I haven&rsquo;t heard that word in ages!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The room went oddly silent, an unsettling creep of power rising. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no problem with that, it&#39;s just that your peers don&rsquo;t like long-minded people,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana nodded willingly, motioning to Lucina that he understood what she meant. &ldquo;The stars&hellip;They speak to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lucina sprang forward slowly from her chair, intrigued by Rukana&rsquo;s testimony. &ldquo;The stars you say?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana&rsquo;s expression lifted in a mystical way, Behatar disgusted by his words. His tall figure stood behind him, already disliking his charming tone that attracted Lucina, the Lord of Wisdom. Rukana&rsquo;s voice whispered gently of aspiration, his bold declaration of his goals now printed into Lucina&rsquo;s mind. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m more than happy to consider these ideas, father time,&rdquo; Lucina beamed. Behatar secretly frowned a disgustful expression of anger, his wrath crawling through his skin edging to violently attack Rukana. Not here. Not now. But how could the newest Lord impress their queen? What was this &ldquo;father time&rdquo; all about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Father Time...&quot; Behatar reiterated heavily, his breath hitching at the thought of Rukana grasping control over a force beyond what any of the other lords could reach. Sure, he controlled strength and their peers could control forces of space and reality, but time? This was too far, exceeding perhaps even of their queen Lucina&rsquo;s abilities. His jaw clenched in agony, determined to understand the true desires Rukana had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you so much madam,&rdquo; Rukana replied politely, leaving the room embraced by the orichalcum mysticism. Behatar hesitantly sat down in front of Lucina, direct with his actions. He clasped his hands together with formality, his eyes of the tiger drawn to the intricately set desk. Pens, ink, fabricated celestial charts and rustic timepieces sat neatly as Behatar&rsquo;s hands struck the surface, scrambling everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lucina, what is your reasoning?&rdquo; Behatar argued. &ldquo;Rukana is inexperienced, yet you trust his dreams? They are dreams! Dreams are not visions. They are indulgences, without consistency and guarantee. Strength builds. Time scatters. Why entrust the High Party to one who speaks of futures he cannot hold?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Strength is temporary. Time is eternal Behatar. You should know better,&rdquo; Lucina explained. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question the wisdom of the universe,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The cold and bold exclamation threatened Behatar&rsquo;s pride, diminishing the already fading energy within the room. It only spiked like a blade unsheathed then, sending a wave of unease into Behatar. His expression grew again, this time a mixture of sorrow and vexation. As he stood up, Lucina sneered unevenly, mocking Behatar once again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go pursue him all you want. I won&rsquo;t stop your murderous intent, but you will see how dreams shape the universe,&rdquo; Lucina scoffed, reaching for an intricate hourglass that sat on a shelf beside the window. The glistening glass separated each grain of sand, flowing in fluid motion that accelerated time. Behatar watched hypnotically, his mind growing in rage by the second. Was this the queen&rsquo;s powers in action? The air grew heavy, Behatar realising that Lucina had scribbled her marking of possession on his arm. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Madam&hellip;You can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; Behatar began, his voice trembling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that what you desire? You hesitate, yet you embody strength. Carry out what you must do,&rdquo; Lucina mocked again, plopping herself back into the comfort of her chair. Behatar remembered the powers of Lucina, her ability to control and possess any living organism through a mark. At that moment, he realised he himself had a dream as well. It was to eradicate Rukana from the High Party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His mind throttled with chaos, ultimately calming through the contagious clarity from Lucina&rsquo;s control. He began to think directly as the mark temporarily bit into his flesh, burning a charcoal rose onto his skin. Lucina had undermined what he had denied: his own dream. Not of ruling, not of serving, but of protecting the High Party from those who strayed too far. At that moment, Behatar realised the dangerous nature of dreams through their endless possibility. He had to end them before they bloomed. In lightning speed, Behatar bolted through the halls chasing the slow paced Rukana striding through the manor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana&rsquo;s sudden realisation sparked at the passive activation of his ability, skipping forward in time to avoid Behatar&rsquo;s lasering attack. &ldquo;Woah! What&rsquo;s wrong Behatar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&hellip;&rdquo; his tone menaced through his teeth, grimacing a visage of grim resolve. &ldquo;Lucina told me not to hesitate, just like how you dream&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana sprang away, lunging inside a random room. His movements were violent, rushing into corners to hide from Behatar&rsquo;s towering strength. Inspecting the room, he noticed a small hatch on the wall. Without hesitation, he yanked it open and jumped through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana entered the futuristic room from the hatch, he spotted a parked jet in front of a cave-like entrance overlooking the sea. Rukana jumped into the jet, spamming the controls. He was going to escape the mess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come back here this instant!&rdquo; Behatar roared, using his ability to transform into a missile. The jet took off, with Behatar following closely behind. The streaks of white lined the skies as the two bolted out of the stratosphere, flying in deep space. Behatar was in full control of his transformation while Rukana still struggled with the jet, fiddling with the controls trying to go faster.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The engine spattered, the flames flickering for a moment. Rukana felt his body squelching in pain, then suddenly jolting forward as the jet violently accelerated forward. It was instantaneous and not continuous, for the fuel had quickly depleted for that short boost. Behatar was catching up again, with the jet only cruising at a steady pace. He didn&rsquo;t know how to go faster with such little fuel remaining. The icon blinked red, signalling for a refuel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His expression worsened as he watched Behatar only grow faster, now side by side to his jet. He gulped in fear as the missile sharply turned into the sides of the jet, piercing the metallic hull. The jet exploded instantly upon impact, the engines violently spewing out crimson flames that were instantly consumed by space. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; Rukana yelled, time skipping forward passively. Behatar missed and Rukana floated in space, motionlessly. As he squirmed in the vast vacuum, he felt a nearby asteroid and held onto it. If he wanted to escape, he had to use it. The jet had broken into hundreds of pieces, the debris now floating in space endlessly for eternity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behatar had transformed back into his original form due to him being unable to hit his target. His powers were limited, but he saw a work around to defeat Rukana. Morphing into a heavy blade now, Behatar steadily aimed towards Rukana staring at his frightened gaze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hit me ever! My powers fully counter yours!&rdquo; Rukana exclaimed, snickering in an attempt to distract or even force retreat in Behatar. Behatar ignored, striking first. His first swing created a small crater within the meteor, carving chunks of rock that scattered into the endless vacuum. The crater was coincidentally the perfect sheltering for Rukana as he slid his body in. Rukana laughed nervously, mocking Behatar. The blade was definitely too large to fit in, and if Behatar had tried to stab him, Rukana was prepared. He knew his power would skip time for him, allowing him to avoid any attack. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haha!&rdquo; Rukana laughed. &ldquo;You missed!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I never aimed for you, inexperienced scum,&rdquo; Behatar spat. With a powerful thrust, the blade struck the meteor. &ldquo;Fool, perish in space,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The force Behatar had landed on the meteor was just enough to send it flying into space, not enough to crack open the meteor. Rukana, still trapped in the crater, panicked. The high velocity and momentum glued his body into the crater, entrapping him in the meteor as it fell through space. Rukana clung desperately, his eyes flicking across the burning surface. Sparks of naked cosmic energy shimmered under the immense heat, plummeting down past the stratosphere. He felt his body suddenly slow down to an unknown force, then a bright sky appeared above him. Had he fallen into a planet? It certainly had life as he saw clouds and the sound of waves. Then, he realised he had been sent to Earth. Nobody knew what this planet was, and loud roars rang from all directions. They were humongous beasts that Rukana didn&rsquo;t even know existed. He had entered extraterrestrial land. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To his eyes, dinosaurs weren&rsquo;t just mere animals but walking cathedrals of bone and primordial energy, their forms shimmering with the heat of a fiercer sun and cloaked in an aura of immense geological weight. The crystalline skin and armored hides were that of cracked bastions, dragging their tails like comet strikes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He couldn&rsquo;t believe what he saw and when neared the water&rsquo;s surface, he was terrified of where he had landed. The further he fell, the more cracked the meteor became, splitting fragments off and shooting them in bizarre directions. One shard even struck the back of a colossal, armoured beast that roared in defiance as the heavens fell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A loud splash sunk Rukana into the depths of Earth&rsquo;s cold blue oceans, submerging him with the deathly corners of the sea. He couldn&rsquo;t be defeated like this. As he gasped for breath, a cosmic miracle struck him, his body responding to his critical situation. He felt time dilate, for he could finally control the passage in which time was flowing. He realised at that moment, there was something hidden deep inside his heart. An ability he had never noticed. Was the Orichalcum star given to him special? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he performed his ability, the world flashed a white light in his eyes, causing the world to slowly spin around his vision. Suddenly, he found himself laying flat, in a white dimension. It was endless, free for him to wander and explore, but most importantly, to reenter anywhere in the timeline at the cost of hibernation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It didn&#39;t feel alien or distant like a cold prison, rather it felt warm, cozy and inviting, incentivising him to stay longer. What was this dimension? Rukana didn&#39;t want to think too long as he toyed around with the holographic numbers. He randomly fiddled with the numbers until finally he decided to not skip hundreds or thousands of years, but rather millions of years into the future, sending himself into a deep sleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He knew he was defeated, but could resurface still. Although he didn&#39;t understand the dynamic of Earth, he assumed that overtime, the planet would be reshaped and that he would be safe to escape his indulgent time loop. He could theoretically finally put an end to the constant time skipping and be revived once more. He skipped and skipped, time to time, hoping to one day escape the sea before he drowned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It had been 165 million years since Rukana had fallen into the waters of eternity. After what seemed to be decades, was actually hundreds and millions of years. His eyes woke to a brilliant surprise. As he exited his white dimension of safety, he found himself buried underwater still, almost drowning again. However, the water was shallow and he surfaced. Where was he? Most importantly, where was the cosmic energy dense meteor? Has it granted mortals or life organisms supernatural power? It was very likely, Rukana unable to shake the fact a force in this world was to hunt him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shallow, natural lake still had Rukana gasping for air, and he was happily surprised that he wasn&#39;t trapped forever underwater, drowning instantly the second he returned to reality. It was a surprise to see how the Earth had changed, of course Rukana didn&#39;t exactly know how long it took. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The world looked different, for he had woken up on the chilling continent of Asia, deep within the Himalayas.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.4bvzbrdh8wnv"><span class="c9">XII - To Believe It</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was believed that during the discovery of the Terracotta Army in 1974 that once served the first emperor, there was a special relic that held immense supernatural power. It was the status of invincibility, protecting the emperor from attacks in the afterlife. It was respectively named the Ank Band, deriving from the defensive titan of a dinosaur, the Ankylosaurus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The Ank Band was found to be crafted from the fossilized hide of an Ankylosaurus, the relic depicted somewhat of the modern day Mobius strip, creating a charming pattern. The shape closely mirrored that of Chinese tokens, adding the connotation of luck. Most people believed that a special force was able to preserve the dinosaur skin, allowing for it to survive millions of years. Some called it luck, some called it of cosmic origin. It was no doubt beneath the mosaic of the hardened earthy scaled textures was a thin layer of cosmic energy that coated every crack of the relic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Chinese farmers first experimented with the relic, many found the defense power of it. It directly contradicted that of Newton&#39;s third law, redirecting any force back at the user instead of equally spreading the force. In other words, the relic was unbreakable and deflected any form of attack.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When Rukana, an alien who woke up from his 165 million year slumber recognised the change in the world, it had perplexed him. He began to notice steel and wooden infrastructures of sorts, depicting them himself as bizarre mountain shapes. He wasn&#39;t accustomed to Earth for how humans had fundamentally altered the landscape in which he had once lived. Metallic machines that moved on rubber circles? Those were cars. He saw them as living metal organisms. Yet beneath the unparalleled sights he had seen, a deeper worry seemed to anguish Rukana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He knew he had lost something. He felt he had lost something relevant to his dreams, his ambitions. It was a reminder from Ajespa to defy all odds and yet, he had lost it. All he remembered was that 165 million years ago, when he had crashed into the Earth, dense cosmic energy and the meteor had wiped out most dinosaurs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Most notably, he remembered fragments of the meteor had been infused with cosmic energy, and that one piece struck and infused its energy into an Ankylosaurus&#39;s tough, armoured skin, creating the Ank Band. It had served for centuries in ancient China and it was finally time for Rukana to retrieve the missing piece. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, with the relic holding such extreme powers, criminals were drawn to it, attracted by the celestial existence of such an entity. Among those eyes that watched this piece of cosmic descent was Rukana, an otherworldly entity. Even though Rukana already had supernatural powers, he wanted to become the ultimate life being, invincible to anything. Alongside his powers to move forward in time, he knew for a fact that if he was able to obtain the relic he would be untouchable. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Until then, he couldn&rsquo;t set out his true conquest to conquer the Earth. He needed humanity to die out first for his journey to finally begin. That was the most ethical and humane way Rukana saw in taking over the planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His ambitions were simple really. He wanted to prove to his peers that he was capable of leading a world where every living organism was under his reign, conquering the Earth. It was an act of impression, making sure he wasn&#39;t undervalued by his peers from worlds away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lying in the Xi&#39;an Museum held securely in glass chambers, it was this morning when the relic had finally arrived, having just finished analysis by the leading supernatural corporations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Rukana lurked behind bushes when the sun began to set, he watched other greedy eyes gaze at the entrance of the museum. He didn&#39;t expect other, if not this many criminals to have come on the very first day the relic had arrived.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The museum&rsquo;s exterior walls were adorned with security, the high alert entrances and exits staring back at them. The museum had become a nature hotspot due to its holding of the relic, with several armed gang members wanting to steal it for themselves. Rukana also wanted it, and knew he could steal it easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voices marched forward as the ambitious thieves snuck through the maximal security of the museum, invading the relic&#39;s terrace. Rukana followed closely, with eyes tracking his senseless motions. There, the relic stood in the centre of the room as the shadows suddenly shuffled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; a pair of armed thieves exclaimed, repositioning themselves among the shady shadows. The sound of a gun clicking rang through the pale overhead lights, sending a sudden sharp static into the ground. The lights hummed again, contrasting the darkened shadows. Then, they flickered with a loud pause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Other criminals began to round up, nearing the main room where the relic stood firm. Rukana stood aside, waiting to take it himself. He knew for a fact that stealing the relic wasn&rsquo;t easy as he had to beat every other criminal. But that sensation changed when he felt a sudden fluctuation in cosmic energy. There was an unsteady sensation that had mingled with Rukana since he stepped foot into the museum, sensing a mystical force was guarding the relic. Was it not?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It felt almost like the shadows were dancing with him, ready to pounce and consume every criminal who began to unsheathe the ancient relic. The glass casing slowly opened as the duo in the center cut a hole out. The lights suddenly dimmed as the room was embraced by black. It was a race to obtain the relic now, but the cat was let out of the bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shadow suddenly surged vertically, robbing the criminals of their life as each of their elegant strides toward the relic was pulled down by a devastatingly loud thud. Someone was hidden among the shadows. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; a criminal yelped. The strange shadow creature had distorted the criminal&rsquo;s shadow which affected his physical body, instantly knocking him out. Rukana took a step back, cautious of the shadows ahead. Indeed he saw the mysterious entity, but what was its purpose? Was it truly to protect the relic or was it for the individual to steal it themselves? It was a rather hard question Rukana had to think about, but alas Rukana couldn&rsquo;t answer it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Show yourself!&rdquo; Rukana exclaimed, in hopes the entity would emerge before him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&hellip;are you?&rdquo; a scorpionic figure emerged from the shadows, his jet black hair and midnight eyes glimmered in the darkness. His expression was melancholic for some reason, his voice painted in grim and unease. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this- malevolent force I recognise?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are of cosmic descent&hellip;What are you?&rdquo; Rukana asked, intrigued by the entity&rsquo;s darkened gaze. He still couldn&rsquo;t see clearly in front of him, the figure still blurred by the shadowy room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Answer my question, or prepare your fate&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am Rukana, and I&rsquo;ve already achieved my goal here,&rdquo; Rukana boasted, sprinting towards the relic. His steps crushed the bodies of the collapsed criminals, boosting his momentum. The entity hurled itself towards Rukana, only for it to reappear in the shadows beyond the relic. It had moved and phased through Rukana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Clutching the relic in his hands, Rukana beelined for the exit. The entity in the shadows regained pursuit upon Rukana, chasing him outside where the charming moonlight struck him, exposing his identity as that of a young boy. It was someone covered in shadows that masked his exterior, contradicting the terrifying beast he was back inside the pitch black room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Reveal yourself!&rdquo; Rukana yelled, stopping at the gate of the museum. His grip on the relic tightened, for he knew he was the rightful owner of it. He knew that the relic was constructed from his own cosmic energy when he had landed on Earth 165 million years ago with the dinosaurs. To him, it was evident but to the boy, his eyes slowly locked onto his own with an ominous intent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>The boy&rsquo;s gaze was hazy, cracking his neck as if he was certain he was going to defeat him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who I am. My name is Wei Yuhang and I will assure you will </span><span class="c4">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be leaving with that relic,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What does it mean to you?&rdquo; Rukana scoffed, laughing at the boy&rsquo;s pride and ego.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei dipped his head down as if he was praying to the gods. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than just a cultural artifact&hellip;It&rsquo;s the fact that you&hellip;also a supernatural wants another supernatural relic! What power do you seek?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Rukana yelled, swiping at Wei. His first attack was slow, Wei easily dodging by reentering the shadows on the ground. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never catch me!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed, swimming in the shadows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Neither will you!&rdquo; Rukana laughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Now angered, Wei was even more determined to defeat Rukana for his actions. As Wei leapt out of the shadows trying to grab Rukana by the ankles, he felt time erase, for he had fallen backwards as if he had grabbed onto imaginary legs. What had just happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei didn&#39;t give up as he was determined to understand the very nature of Rukana&#39;s ability, dying to dissect how he manipulated time. That way, he could actually trap him and beat him. If he was able to drag him into the shadows, he had a chance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Quietly, Wei snuck around deep within the shadows as Rukana guessed at the ground, stomping randomly not knowing how Wei&#39;s ability worked either. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Wei began to strangle Rukana&#39;s shadow, indirectly attacking him. He felt a similar force pressuring the same violent move on himself, even though he was already camouflaged in the shadows. It wasn&#39;t artificial from Rukana, rather the force felt natural, as an act of rejection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Die&hellip;already!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed, holding onto his breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Guh,&rdquo; Rukana choked. Quickly, he blipped himself into hibernation, speeding time up for a few seconds. Wei sprang out of the ground, out of the shadows, finally being able to catch his breath as the force had dissolved. For Rukana, he had disappeared from reality. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Wei exclaimed, his eyes darting around. Suddenly, Rukana reappeared in time, realising Wei had left the shadows and was in front of him. With a simple kick, Rukana pushed Wei forwards, tumbling down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m&hellip;not done!&rdquo; Wei exclaimed, reshaping parts of his own shadow to be of a sword. &nbsp;With a reckless, unplanned brutal swing, Wei aimed to break Rukana into pieces with a singular blow. He hung all his strength into the strike, hitting his shadow hard enough to hurt him, knowing well he would also be damaged. But at the cost of defeating Rukana? It was worth it in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Haven&#39;t you learnt your lesson?&rdquo; Rukana yelled, angrily lecturing Wei. Wei violently heaved the sword forward that was cast among the shadows, his own blade bouncing directly off of Rukana&#39;s shadow and back into his own skull. What had happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then Wei realised the true nature of the Ank Band. It wasn&#39;t a simple cosmic relic, rather it was complex, able to deflect any attack, making wielders immune. How could just a complimenting relic fall into the hands of Rukana? It harmonised too well, granting him practically invincibility. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A fragment of black smoke leaked out from his brain, a section of his shadow now fractured. He wasn&#39;t dead, for it was his own ability that hurt him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t try to pursue me&hellip;if you attack, you will die!&rdquo; Rukana reiterated. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei was clearly critically injured and needed help. Rukana had left him for dead, not killing him. It was at this moment Wei knew Rukana was out for his ambition and not for blood. There was something greater at stake. He was making himself invincible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wei weakly grasped onto Rukana&#39;s shadow, his arm clutching his ankle. For once, Rukana didn&#39;t skip time. Wei&#39;s action was not a form of pursuit or attack, it was an act of desperation and distress. Rukana&#39;s next few steps through the arid plains rustled his garments, loosening the strap the Ank Band was tied to. It dropped onto the ground silently, entering the shadows where Wei had hidden it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You!&rdquo; Rukana asserted, realising Wei&#39;s mischievous actions. &ldquo;Thieving scum! I&#39;ll still outlast humanity without true invincibility!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana stomped at the shadows against the intangible Wei who was hidden within. Still, Wei was scared for his life. He laid quietly in solitude in his shadows as the footsteps faded away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Director&hellip;&rdquo; Wei whimpered weakly into the ear piece. His voice was fragile, laced in fear. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;need help&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His fragile voice met with urgent paramedics that flew helicopters down towards the ground, rapidly treating Wei&#39;s wounds. His shadow wound was deep, for a strange cosmic signal leaking out of his blood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will you get him?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will try my best. He&#39;s strong, but not impossible to beat. I&#39;m sure your peers would find a way,&rdquo; their director commended. &ldquo;I&#39;m sure your ambitions won&#39;t be set aside,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His voice calmed him, knowing that this time, he could rely on the power of his peers. Only they could finish what he had started. They had to be able to defeat Rukana. No matter the scenario, Wei dreamt that they would come out on top.</span></p><h3 class="c5" id="h.ryhqdunc0h61"><span class="c9">XIII - To Dream It</span></h3><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The plane noisily descended into the cold plateau of Kathmandu, Iseul and Rayne disembarking with one goal in mind. It was rare for the two boys to have some time off, for they were supernatural agents working for the International Supernatural Intelligence Division. They had been training meticulously for the past weeks, strengthening their bodies and growing their minds. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kathmandu felt like a bucket-list dream, the two boys wanting to experience true snow for once. They wanted to explore the mountains and potentially even climb Mount Everest. It was ambitious, but it didn&#39;t stop Iseul and Rayne. They had the entire week to spend, now excited more than ever. They were dreamers at heart, loving adventure and companionship, embracing the more emotional sides of their zodiacs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What should we do first?&rdquo; Rayne asked ecstatically, overwhelmed by the chilling but inviting atmosphere of Kathmandu. It felt oriental, drawing close to ancient Asia culture with large temples, towering in solitude within the main city. Their somewhat alien nature towards the city and culture exposed them like saplings in a hurricane. It was chaotic at first, especially with the warm and vibrant colours that adorned shops and streets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dunno, let&#39;s get some food first though cause I&#39;m hungry!&rdquo; Iseul smiled, wandering out of the airport. As they exited the airport, the grand, historical buildings juxtaposed the monochromatic palette of the landscape, adding a much needed contrast that unsheathed the natural beauty Kathmandu offered. It was more wonderful than the boys had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The air carried a clinical but also vintage, reminiscent of pine wood scent, lofting above the two boys. Each step upon the cobbled streets sprang a quiet trot, approaching the alley of vendors, smoking in umami flavours. The fragrance stabbed the boys hard, the pungency of yak meat and spice vegetables lingered in their mouths. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at that!&quot; Rayne pointed to an elderly vendor crafting intricate metal bowls by hand, the rhythmic hammering echoing off the stone walls. &quot;Everything here feels so... timeless.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Upon the sunset in Kathmandu&rsquo;s frigid environment, the mountain tides swept down, weaving through the landscape like natural waves. Silence remained still, consuming everything but the frozen winds that howled occasionally. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A figure hallowed in the light, trudging into view of the town square. The strange figure, depicted that of a man had finally arrived somewhere he could call home. Kathmandu had felt alien enough to embody that his home planet, Ajespa, a planet lost to time. The silent and distinct scent of the rocky earth and fresh snow waffled through the air, inviting the mysterious figure to the divine location.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah, that guy looks like Jesus&hellip;&rdquo; Rayne commented, tapping on Iseul&#39;s shoulder. As he chewed another huge chunk of meat, Iseul gazed directly towards the man, enveloped by a strange sensation. It felt distant, yet so close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man shuffled forward in frail movements, passing through time as if it didn&#39;t exist. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeez, he sure looks younger than what he actually appears&hellip;&rdquo; Iseul added. Rayne nodded, concerned at the limping man. &ldquo;It&#39;s been a minute and he&#39;s barely moved!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The crowd chattered quietly, ignoring the strange man&#39;s behaviour as he walked across the alley. A girl, carrying a vase glanced at the situation, ultimately ignoring the bizarre occurrence in the town square. Her eyes sensed something off, something distinctly different from a natural human.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, Rukana being the strange man thought differently. He wasn&#39;t old, he was tired and weak because he hadn&#39;t eaten for days. Of course, he agreed with Iseul&#39;s claim, he didn&#39;t care about time. He had all of the time in the universe. It was only a matter of time before he would conquer the world. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To Rukana, it had only been about 165 million years since he had landed on Earth. After he went into hibernation, he had only awakened recently. He expected that sooner or later, humanity would fall, and only then could he reclaim the planet as his. Indeed he was a soulless hermit who had wandered far away to the edge of time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ahhh, peace&hellip;&rdquo; he bellowed, bathing under the cool sunlight. &ldquo;My time has finally risen! I will show them who is the king!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It became suspicious when residents began to clear the streets, sensing an unnatural flow of energy that disrupted the natural drift. The man had not moved, still standing under the sun. The town square was menacingly silent, only the sound of Rayne thinking being audible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rayne thought that it was a strict curfew at first until he felt time move forward. It felt unnatural, malignant even. Suddenly, an alert on their phones rang like wailing sirens, it was from their organisation, theInternational Supernatural Intelligence Division. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Alert: Watch out for cosmic threats! Relic was stolen days ago by an unknown entity.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man&rsquo;s gaze shifted at the sound of the notification, drawing fascination at the mechanical tablet of some sort. He was somehow intrinsically pulled towards the two boys, glancing at the flashing screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Woah! Stand back bro!&rdquo; Rayne exclaimed, frightened by the man&rsquo;s nonexistent sense of privacy. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Iseul scrolled the alert, a photograph of the figure terrified the man, smashing the phone immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;How do you know who I am?&rdquo; The man violently scowled, leaning up close and getting personal with the boys. It was clear that the man was not happy realising he had caused a cosmic disruption.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Wonderstruck, the two boys had realised the terrible truth. Their vacation was cut short by an unexpected encounter. What was the threat doing here in Kathmandu? The photograph Iseul just saw was clearly the man in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What did you do to our friend?&rdquo; Iseul yelled emotionally, scared from the inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was your friend?&rdquo; the man asked awkwardly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter! You&rsquo;re a threat, and we&rsquo;re going to make sure nobody else gets hurt!&rdquo;Rayne exclaimed, ready to fight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Iseul and Rayne had fully given their attention to the man now, ready to attack. As they strung along a chain of attacks, something felt strange. Their attack floated through their target, almost as if the man had paused time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mortals wielding powers of the cosmic?&rdquo; the man questioned, smirking in excitement. &ldquo;What are you two supposed to be?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Pisces and Cancer,&rdquo; Iseul scowled, his expression drawn with suspicion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you supposed to be?&rdquo; asked Rayne.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The man paused and thought for a moment. Who was he? He never was given a title but he was still theoretically a Jespan Lord. &ldquo;I am Rukana, the Jespan Lord of Time! I will outlast you all!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tch,&rdquo; Iseul sneered. &ldquo;As if! I know your abilities already!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is understanding going to do? Even if you try, any form of attack or direct pursuit will be skipped!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rayne couldn&#39;t believe Rukana had exposed his ability, but his explanation was so absurd he couldn&#39;t understand it fully. Was he completely immune to attacks? When he had said to skip attacks, Rayne concluded that he skipped time itself. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He leapt forward, testing his theory out. He shot a stream of bubbles, directed at Rukana. The bubbles suddenly appeared on the other side of Rukana, confirming his powers. Rayne finally understood it. He moved the attack further into the timeline and erased the time between. He was undoubtedly unbeatable in his eyes. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Iseul began to flail his serpent around violently without control as he began to understand how Rukana performed. He let his mind roam free, allowing the natural flow to control the serpent. It was chaotic at first, but his serpent became slower the longer Iseul tried to sustain it. The unnatural movements let the serpent wander into Rukana, but it didn&#39;t stop his ability to activate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>&ldquo;Why can&#39;t I hit you? I&#39;m not </span><span class="c4">pursuing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or actively trying to attack you, so why can&#39;t I hit you?&rdquo; Iseul complained, frustrated by Rukana&#39;s arrogance. His expression grew sinister, a darker grin moulding onto his face. Iseul watched in disgust, a larger flame growing internally within his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How do you dream?&rdquo; Rukana asked, mocking Iseul&#39;s question. He felt Iseul lacked knowledge, his question asking for a completely obvious answer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Does&hellip;everything dream?&rdquo; Iseul asked, undermining Rukana&#39;s thrilling question. His simple response was enough for Rukana to lean back and pause, Iseul believing he had a window of opportunity. Was fate speaking again? Was this his opportunity? He let his serpent naturally dance among Rukana, hitting him in the cross fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Iseul felt a sharp pain in his stomach, a force that kicked him backwards. Rukana had somehow moved in front of him, sending him crashing into a wall. It felt like time had dilated forwards, Iseul walking into a predetermined position. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your question&hellip;&rdquo; Rukana began. &ldquo;Destiny rules over fate, and that cannot be changed! Dreams only move one forward!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So if I shoot my bubbles without intent, does it still count as pursuit?&rdquo; Rayne asked, smirking as he devised his plan. He was influenced by Iseul&#39;s actions, believing it was a path in the right direction in beating Rukana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you rather risk innocents just to defeat me?&rdquo; Rukana laughed. &ldquo;I&#39;m not a threat to humanity, all I can do is fast forward time! I&#39;m not interested in killing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rayne froze, as he pondered the philosophical question Rukana had raised. Was it worth protecting the world if it meant to kill some innocents? He couldn&#39;t push the thought off. He stood there trembling in the empty town square. There wasn&#39;t anybody in sight, but his head told him not to. He shook his head, clearing his thoughts and followed his heart. His emotions dug in deep into his veins, allowing for a purely thoughtless driven intent and attack. His bubbles burst through, shooting out in all directions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you forget? Anything that comes or is directed to me is considered an attack,&rdquo; Rukana smiled. Iseul watched in concern, his vision suddenly skipping forward in time to see an explosion ridden to town square. Nearby walls were ripped through, exposing the bare interiors of shops. A porcelain vase fell over with a thud, not breaking. Iseul&#39;s eyes locked onto the object. Then he remembered what their Director had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">&ldquo;Remember, cosmic entities are naturally drawn to other cosmic entities,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Iseul felt an ominous sensation gripping his body, pulling him into darkness. It reminded him of an agent that had a similar ability to manipulate shadows. But this felt different. It was much colder. His eyes darted around for a moment before he suddenly opened them back to the blinding sunlight. A place that no light could enter? He didn&#39;t know, but he was intrinsically pulled towards the vase. It felt magical in a sense, the darkness inside felt of the millions of possibilities time had to dream and fate itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he felt Rukana reappear, successfully skipping forward time, Iseul noticed his position. He had somehow lined himself perfectly against the vase. Without hesitation, Iseul leapt forward, charging at Rukana without a thought. A second passed, then he appeared on the ground. Rukana had skipped time again. This time, he was directly next to the fallen vase. He felt an energy that pulled him closer, then saw a silhouette rushing down the steps.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No! Stay away from the vase!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;re&hellip;a Zodiac user&hellip;aren&#39;t you?&rdquo; Iseul whispered. His hands firmly gripped the vase, attempting to grab it for himself. The girl pulled back lifting the vase while Iseul clutched on as if his life depended on it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, let go!&rdquo; the girl yelled, drawing the attention of Rukana once more. He turned to the girl, with his expression staring her down. He scanned the girl, immediately sensing her of cosmic energy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Rukana demanded. &ldquo;What are your powers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The girl let go suddenly, sending Iseul flying back into the ground with a loud thud. His grip on the vase loosened again, letting the vase fly freely into the air. Rukana, his gaze still fixed on the girl, ignored the vase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; Rukana demanded, raising his voice. Suddenly, he felt an overwhelming pressure, an inescapable intent of pursuit. His eyes darted up, to see the vase falling down towards his face. As he glanced up, he didn&#39;t see the vase&#39;s bottom. There was no bottom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;My name is Stella J&#39;Ning&hellip;&rdquo; Stella whimpered, terrified at Rukana&#39;s voice. &ldquo;That&#39;s&hellip;my vase&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana&#39;s eyes bulged out, widening at the sight of an endless void. The vase was a gate to the void? It was paradoxical in a way, contradicting his dreams. Was it fate that struck him? He let out a terrifying scream, sensing the vase as a manifestation of the inevitable fate he had tried to avoid. Was it inevitable?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rayne watched as Rukana froze within his own paradox, unable to escape what he had created. Even Iseul didn&#39;t intend to defeat Rukana like this. It wasn&#39;t natural. It was purely accidental through an unexpected chain of cause and effect. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana had his final trick up his sleeve. Although his passive time skip was already activating where it assumed the vase was an attack of some sort, he prepared his alternate ability.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As time dilated forward, Rukana spammed at his hibernation ability, begging for the gate to open for him to travel into the safety of his white dimension. He wanted to remove himself out of the timeline temporarily and come back again at a later time when the vase was gone. The white dimension was his only escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana&rsquo;s body jolted forward again as he felt a magnetic pull tug him away into the confines of his dimension. For a moment, everything went white. Then the world flashed in front of his eyes. The next thing Rukana knew, he was alive again somehow and somewhere. His hibernation ability must have worked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahahaha! I&#39;m alive! Even the void kneels to father time!&rdquo; Rukana snickered, pointing at the girl and the vase rudely. His laugh was vicious, devastatingly loud. &ldquo;You can&#39;t beat me!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana violently swung at the girl with full force, just for his kick to phase through her body. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He kicked, then punched, again and again. Something was terribly wrong. As he tried interacting with the other two zodiac users and the world, nothing living existed. All non-living objects remained solid, but everything else was a mere projection. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana hurriedly ran towards an apartment, surveying any other changes to reality. Everything worked as usual and Rukana drew the conclusion that perhaps it was just due to the void and his ability colliding, creating a reality where life could not exist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hahahaha! This is my utopia!&rdquo; Rukana felt relieved, celebrating his victory. It was over for the Zodiacs, for a Jespan Lord has finally prevailed. He could finally conquer the world. Was there anything left for Rukana to do? Nothing could challenge him anymore. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he left the apartment, he felt a cold touch on his neck. Life in this reality? It couldn&#39;t be. He had made sure that anything living was ghost-like. He had tested with plants and humans, and for something to touch him meant something existed in this world with life. His heartbeat violently spiked, terrified.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was only then he saw the black fog spread from the corner of his eye, infecting every surface it touched. Rukana stumbled to the ground like a baby, away from the direction he felt the touch. His body trembled and eyes bulged as if he had seen a ghost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rukana?&rdquo; a voice echoed. Rukana couldn&#39;t speak. He had never been this terrified before. Was he about to die? The projection in front of him felt so real. It was a girl that looked eerily similar to the one before. How had she revived herself? It was a horrific scene that Rukana couldn&#39;t open his eyes to. He prayed mentally his abilities could save him. As he attempted to skip time, nothing happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Y&hellip;y&hellip;.yes?&rdquo; Rukana whimpered like a dog. &ldquo;Who&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&#39;ve entered the void. Like I said before&hellip;My name is Stella J&#39;Ning, the Aquarius Bearer. This is the void, nothing gets out except me. You&#39;ve deserved this death,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana gasped. &ldquo;No&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The frightening pull tugged on his body, dragging him out of the illusion. A devastatingly loud scream and yells of terror was immediately muffled by the silence of the void, oppressing his voice. Reality faded to black like the end of a movie, choking him among the shadows. The darkness ripped his flesh apart in a grotesque scene, the eternity consuming his remains. It was a slow and painful death as he drifted motionlessly into the void. He had skipped time just microseconds too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Iseul! Are you alright?&rdquo; Rayne exclaimed back in reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m fine!&rdquo; Iseul smiled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; Rayne added, noticing the girl picking her vase up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s up with you two boys? Lost?&rdquo; Stella asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your name is Stella right?&rdquo; Iseul began. &ldquo;We&#39;re just dreamers&hellip;who just happened to have wandered here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Stella sighed, resting upon her fallen vase. &ldquo;Well? What are your names?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mine&#39;s Rayne Deyus, and his is Iseul Baem,&rdquo; Rayne smiled. He walked beside Stella, casting a singular bubble into the air. Iseul&#39;s serpent jumped upwards, playfully popping the explosive bubble. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cool abilities&hellip;&rdquo; Stella giggled. It was unusually quiet, for Stella it wasn&#39;t a surprise. For Rayne, it was a shock, for he had expected people to be around. Was Rukana&#39;s question worthless, to buy him time? Rayne couldn&#39;t shake the fact that it could&#39;ve been. It felt strange, for one immortal deity to be killed so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rukana&rsquo;s soulless remains drifted motionlessly, into eternity. He couldn&#39;t think. He couldn&#39;t dream. He couldn&#39;t pursue it. Trapped in his own dichotomy. He couldn&rsquo;t even prove himself. Not for himself, but to the others. Was there no place for dreamers? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Stella warmly invited Rayne and Iseul into her cozy apartment. It was relaxing, calming even. The three chattered amongst themselves all afternoon, unable to ground themselves back into reality. Their dreams had taken over, and all they could think about was who they were meant to be. Everything was dreaming. At that moment, the three understood that pursuit could only occur when one dreamed of winning. They knew that couldn&rsquo;t happen if they dreamt of all the possibilities, even those of loss and destruction. To dream is to fate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
