Cosmic energy is infinitely produced by living stars. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When combined within certain minerals or infused and or enchanted with objects, outputs can produce supernatural abilities, granting mortals or even objects mystical properties. </span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.vbi8tnyododu"><span class="c3">I - Picture This!</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A case cannot solve itself. That was the motto of the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. Operated in the depths of Indianapolis, the division had recently received a bizarre mystery. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Tom, we&#39;re stumped...The men, all twenty-three of them we&#39;ve sent...they&#39;ve all gone missing without a trace!&quot; Barry said, his voice lingering in concern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tom dropped his head into his hands and looked down, with nothing but frustration in his mind. &quot;I know! I know! Can you please shut up? What am I supposed to do?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What about the intern? Crazy smart 19-year-old kid, who finished a master&#39;s in anthropology! He said he&#39;s coming in today!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m not risking it! I could be fired!&quot; Tom yelled, slamming his fist into the desk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The door slowly creaked open upon Tom&#39;s last words, as a dark silhouette appeared, fading in, uncloaking a boy with wavy umber hair and a pair of mystic black eyes of death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I couldn&#39;t help but overhear you two,&quot; the boy smiled. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; Tom asked, still angry. The boy gracefully ran his fingers through his hair, flicking it backwards. Barry, disappointed, facepalmed and swivelled around on his chair, regaining his attention to his computer where he was halfway through his work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;El-&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re Elias right?&quot; Tom interrupted. Barry couldn&#39;t hold his laughter and giggled, frustrating Tom even more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There&#39;s a case here. The Mona Lisa, 23 disappearances. Some say there&#39;s a curse attached, but I don&#39;t buy it,&quot; Tom mumbled, tossing a folder toward Elias. &quot;Read through that, and good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias caught the folder, flipping through the file&#39;s sparse notes and thinking back to what had led him here. He knew of his talents that paved this path, and he knew if it meant facing off with a so-called cursed painting, so be it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, Elias disliked this ignorant attitude, catching the folder with ease. He quickly flipped through it and skimmed the brief, highlighting the phrase: &quot;23 Disappearances on this Case&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well? What are you waiting for?&quot; Tom yelled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Jesus Tom! Shut the fuck up!&quot; Barry interrupted. &quot;He&#39;s the fucking intern!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The plane flight was tedious, but Elias pulled through the jet lag and landed in Paris. He&#39;d never been to Europe and had only seen media of it, and experiencing everything all at once was like a dream come true. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Louvre was more than an experience, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see, to view ancient paintings, artifacts and stories. The faint scent of polished wood and stone of the Louvre mingled with the lingering breath of time as Elias entered the grandeur rooms of the exhibition, emitting a magical aura. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias was careful, not to seem suspicious. He slowly made his way towards the Mona Lisa painting, where the majority of the people had gathered around. Suddenly, a hand rested on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias turned around, shocked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Been a while, hasn&#39;t it Elias?&quot; James smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;James? I haven&#39;t seen you since high school!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What brings you here?&quot; James asked. &quot;I&#39;m here on vacation!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Work for me,&quot; Elias said, rolling his eyes. &quot;Got into a supernatural intelligence division...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really? That sounds cool!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The people there are dicks,&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s unfortunate...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, this is my first case, and it&#39;s about the Mona Lisa...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Did you know, the Mona Lisa has a flaw? I&#39;ve heard rumours that DaVinci has a badly placed stroke near the hands...&quot; James remarked. James walked forward for a better view and reached out, pointing at the flaw. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t get that close!&quot; Elias chirped. James didn&#39;t hear Elias through the thick noise produced by the crowd, unaware of his surroundings. Then, a man pushed forward through the crowd, bumping James and making him lose his balance. His hand unfortunately scraped the painting, leaving a faint mark on it as he descended and landed on the ground with an oof.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;James! Are you good?&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine- Argh!&quot; James screamed as he got up. His hand was gone, literally cut off, but there was no blood, surprisingly. His hand had seemed to disappear out of thin air, Elias considering that James&#39;s hand might have been translated into a different dimension.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aaah!&quot; a man screamed, fading away. Elias&#39;s eyes darted around the room and witnessed people disappearing, along with their body parts. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Elias yelled. He drew his attention back to the Mona Lisa painting. The woman in the painting was gone and chaos had begun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! Help! Help me-&quot; James screamed as the rest of his body faded away, leaving only his face. It wasn&#39;t long before everything went dark for Elias, for he was also transferred into a new, magical realm. It was indeed dark, Elias&#39;s vision was engulfed with shadows and only after what seemed to be hours, did Elias finally slowly open his tired eyes to see the clear blue sky. James quickly approached Elias and leaned down, helping Elias up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! You&#39;re awake!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Where are we?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Didn&#39;t you major in history? You should know this!&quot; James panicked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Jesus, it&#39;s anthropology, not history. I&#39;ll take a look,&quot; Elias replied frailly. &quot;It can&#39;t be...This isn&#39;t our world...We&#39;re in a different dimension...It feels like it...And it also feels like we&#39;re in 16th-century Europe!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;We need to get outta here,&quot; a man said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I agree,&quot; James added. &quot;But where do we start?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There...&quot; Elias announced. He pointed towards a small flight of stairs that began just up ahead, just beyond the path. A massive castle stood upon them, and the only thing that blocked them from entering it was the set of doors. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they crossed the cobbled footpath and descended the flight of stairs, a small sign with the word &quot;Library&quot; in serif letters was placed beside the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">James pushed the creaking wooden door open, flooding the pitch-black library with the bright sunlight. The walls were infested with mould and cracks, implying the abandoned nature of the structure. The bookshelves seemed untouched, with them reaching to the ceiling, acting as pillars of some sort. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias carefully stepped into the library, with the dust-ridden floor creating squeaky sounds that echoed amongst the bookshelves. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at all this dirt, guh!&quot; a woman exclaimed. &quot;Those cobwebs! Yuck!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Indeed, the library seemed abandoned, but the books seemed clean, and shinier than anything else in place. It certainly contrasted the dull brown palette adopted by the library, creating somewhat of a welcoming yet ominous atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Phones everyone! Turn your flashlight on and start looking around!&quot; Elias commanded. It was suddenly much brighter with the addition of the flashlights, making it much easier to navigate the labyrinth-like layout of a library.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Now isn&#39;t the time to smoke Howard...&quot; a woman barked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Lisa, this helps me calm down!&quot; Howard explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Smoking? Great! Give me that lighter!&quot; Elias exclaimed. Howard stood in shock, with his lighter in his hand. Elias snatched it and smiled. &quot;Thanks, man, and don&#39;t smoke in here,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">James helped Elias light the candles in the library, adding some natural light that helped illuminate the darkness and help conserve the batteries of their phones. It was much cosier now that there was some sort of light, and hence they were able to begin exploring.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at this Elias, a book.&quot; James signalled. He picked the book titled &quot;Divine Arts&quot; up from a nearby table and flipped it open. People nearby huddled beside James, trying to read the contents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;May the most tender item lead to a graceful flight. Maybe sometimes you must not just paint through the night.&quot; Elias read. &quot;I&#39;m assuming tender refers to the youngest thing in the library...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll start checking the books,&quot; a woman added.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Same here!&quot; another chirped in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t long before everyone began to search for the youngest thing. Elias didn&#39;t care about the books, he pondered on the statement as he explored the library.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Many people began inspecting the bookshelves to analyse the most recent books, but there was no luck. Instead of success, only misfortune came in the shape of fantastical yet horrendous monsters. The books the people checked slowly transformed into horrible, bloodthirsty creatures with a pair of wings and sharp, pointy teeth. They were relentlessly chasing whoever opened them and chomping their arms, legs or even heads off. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The group was in shambles, screams filled the maze of bookshelves and chaos was imminent. Panic quickly arose and Elias realised that this was nothing he had done before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Youngest...&quot; Elias thought. &quot;Time...?&quot; Elias gazed at the grandfather clock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...doesn&#39;t this look like the Mona Lisa?&quot; James interrupted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What does?&quot; Elias asked while he remained lost in thought by the grandfather clock. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That canvas...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias darted his eyes to the green canvas, realising that it was indeed the half-finished Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know where we are...and I think I know how to get out...&quot; Elias muttered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hurry up! There&#39;s a ghost coming!&quot; James screamed. Elias again, turned around to see in shock the abomination of a ghost that faded into existence. A devilish green monster, plagued with ridiculous wrinkles and demon red eyes appeared, of what seemed to resemble the Mona Lisa.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You dare fool around here?&quot; the Mona Lisa hissed. In the background, the constant flapping of book monsters ticked Elias, annoying him ever so more. The gruesome squeals of pain and death were inevitable, as the book monsters began slowly consuming the remaining people one by one. It was complete chaos and all some could do was run; they didn&#39;t have time to mourn the death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, distract the ghost!&quot; Elias directed, taking out his gun. He loaded a magazine into the gun and aimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? How?&quot; James asked. However, it was too late for Elias had already run back and began shooting a few book monsters down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa took advantage of James as he didn&#39;t know how to distract her, crawling into his skin and haunting him. James was scared. It felt like thousands of glass shards had pierced his skin, and the sensation of the ghostly figure phasing through his body made him tremble with utter fear. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His breath hitched, coming in shallow gasps, followed by his heart beating at the speed of light, forcing cold sweat to drip from his forehead. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Please...Don&#39;t kill me!&quot; James wailed as he stumbled to the ground. He gazed up, the Mona Lisa loomed over him with a deathly stare. Her eyes were like the devil&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Back off!&quot; Elias shouted, firing a bullet at the Mona Lisa. The bullet phased through the ghostly properties of her body, striking the wall. The Mona Lisa somehow felt the sensation of an object passing through her body and turned her attention towards Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa slowly closed the distance between it and Elias and mumbled, &quot;Why do humans trespass on this sacred land?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Fuck! One bullet left...&quot; Elias exclaimed as he inspected the barrel. &quot;Unless...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; James yelled. Elias hesitated, quickly scanning the area again to make sure he was right. He knew something was off about the location and that there was a much larger problem with higher stakes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the grandfather clock struck midday, and the pendulum swung back and forth and produced a deafening vibration that paralysed the Mona Lisa in place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias suddenly realised that time was the key, and that the grandfather clock played a vital role in the solution of the curse. There was this strange tingling sensation that suddenly crawled underneath his skin, making Elias feel the weight of his decision. What if he was wrong? What if this would seal them all here forever? He glanced at James, whose face was pale with fear but who managed a nod of trust.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No more ghosts,&quot; Elias muttered, steadying his hand. With a deep breath and on the third strike of the pendulum, he pulled the trigger. The gunshot echoed through the room, shattering the canvas in a blink of an eye. For a moment, silence engulfed the room, and Elias stood firm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Why did you shoot the canvas?&quot; James wailed. &quot;Now we&#39;re never getting out!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, James. We are getting out. Da Vinci&#39;s intention in painting the Mona Lisa was to emphasise the beauty and mystery of life, and there appears to be a mistake that seems to oppose the perfect values Da Vinci had imagined,&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What, the Mona Lisa is ugly?&quot; James replied. The Mona Lisa suddenly slipped, falling face first on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, exactly. This isn&#39;t the real world, but rather a manifestation of Da Vinci&#39;s dream,&quot; Elias explained. &quot;These are fragments of his thoughts that have still lingered after his death.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re saying the Mona Lisa is impure and there&#39;s something fucked up about it?&quot; James questioned. The Mona Lisa began to become more transparent by the second. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Remember the flaw you noticed in the painting? That stroke may be the curse itself, the imperfection that haunted him. By breaking down these illusions, we&#39;re dismantling how Da Vinci saw the Mona Lisa after death!&quot; Elias added.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Mona Lisa had vanished from existence with no trace left behind. The book monsters fell to the ground, one by one like targets on a shooting range. The curse was slowly fading and so did they too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;His view, poisoned by a single mistake, became a curse. Now that it&#39;s destroyed, people will accept its beauty, and as we return to the present, time will heal the memory of that flaw.&quot; Elias continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait...I think we&#39;re going back! We just lifted the curse!&quot; James exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, we did it. Let&#39;s go!&quot; Elias laughed. The surviving bunch cheered, and then a violent force suddenly tugged on everyone&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait what&#39;s happening?&quot; James screamed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot; another commented.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Help!&quot; another added.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One by one, they were pulled towards the mysterious portal, with the ground slipping away beneath them. Arms flailed and voices shouted as they struggled against the unseen force. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s our way out! Hold on!&quot; Elias clenched his fists and closed his eyes, hoping for the best and surviving the trip back to reality. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air around them grew thinner by the minute, vibrating with energy as the portal&#39;s centre opened wider, pulsing with a strange, otherworldly light. It swallowed them whole, one by one until only the echo of their voices remained in the space they left behind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wake up...&quot; Elias mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh?&quot; James groaned. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You passed out for a good hour...&quot; Elias explained. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh...&quot; James stood up and gathered his balance with Elias&#39;s help. His hand was back, though the ones that died in that realm were still gone. Elias didn&#39;t think people would die in front of them, yet a ghost appeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Guess that&#39;s one case I&#39;ll never forget,&quot; Elias remarked, with a slight smirk on his face. He glanced back at the Mona Lisa, now back to normal and felt finally relieved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite the case being solved, an uneasy feeling entered his mind of a domino effect and a chain of the most bizarre cases ever raised by mankind. Elias stood there and gazed at the painting for a final time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without warning, a loud bang echoed through the room as the entrance door was flung wide open in a split second. Several armed security men barged into the Louvre, surrounding Elias and the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Freeze!&quot; the guard shouted. &quot;Who are you all? How did you get in here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait a minute...That painting...It&#39;s back to normal!&quot; another guard exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who did this?&quot; another guard questioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias stepped forward with his hands in the pockets of his large navy jacket and began, &quot;Well excuse me men, I did. I&#39;d suppose you&#39;d want to hear the whole story, so, picture this...&quot;</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.3gyjlsk4xmbd"><span class="c3">II - The Phantasmal Dr. Chess</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Amongst the whole of a grim, ghastly and tainted ghost town was the unparalleled doctor&rsquo;s mansion, standing in solitude in the abandoned mess. It was particularly during the autumn days when the thick fog hung oppressively low near the earth, residents of the neighbouring town would visit. This would occur annually as a hideous disease of some sort had infected them, with this mystique of an entity doctor could only cure them. Who was this man? And why was it this town? The infection only began to grow within the past year, with travelers around the world coming to the unknown location to be treated by him. His manor was monochrome in fashion, decorated by poetic yet bleak walls with graphic patterns. Windows were drawn rectangular as to convention, but his shady taste in curtains was outrageously contrasting, employing a sickening green that rebelled the pale, pastel exterior. Nobody knew the doctor well enough surprisingly, although he had quite a reputable status among curing the incurable. All that was known about the man was that he was most commonly nicknamed, Dr. Chess for his religious and excessive habit of playing chess with all his patients. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t though for some odd reason that Dr. Chess had asked his patients for more patients, suggesting that he wasn&rsquo;t looking for work, rather occupied with other studies that the public ignored. For he was a doctor indeed, but nobody questioned his credibility as an actual doctor. His regular yearly patients knew his stable reputation, trusting his process of curing their illnesses. It definitely felt surreal, but for someone as smart as him, he lived alone in isolation, with no feeling of joy. At least that was what who visited them said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When it was Autumn again in New York in 1999, the grim facade of futuristic advancements took a toll on the city&rsquo;s vibrance, the bleak outset of the skyline shouted of mundaneness. But the ever so effervescent feeling of a strange new force that swept through the streets like wind blew ever so strongly, affecting just a few individuals. What seemed like a calling from space, wasn&rsquo;t just a mystical touch or enchantment to an individual&rsquo;s body, it was going to leave a permanent scar no matter what. When Jason fell sick on a rainy Autumn day when he was in Times Square, he sought medical help among the technologically advanced medicine and health industry, operating with cyber-like machinery nobody had ever worked with before. It was an era of experiments, but no doctors from the grand state of New York could cure him. It was almost like his disease of some sort was otherworldly. But Jason didn&rsquo;t believe in ghosts or the supernatural. He never even liked anything to do with the paranormal, not even enjoying literacy fiction such as the popular comics of his time. His friends, Felix and Magnus were into such media, engrossed in the latest editions of Superman and Spiderman. While Felix and Magnus, both still healthy with caring attitudes offered Jason solutions, Jason couldn&rsquo;t help but reject them. He didn&rsquo;t believe their nonsense suggestions of some bizarre magician who lived on the outskirts of the country. He didn&rsquo;t want help, for he had almost accepted his fate of death until he realised he couldn&rsquo;t die. The disease wasn&rsquo;t threatening enough to take his life, the only effects limiting his output in routine was of his eternal hallucinations of fate. He saw everything, the way things moved, the way people spoke and the ways people died. Everywhere around him, the illusions haunted him as another nightmarish event would happen to innocent passerbys. Every person he looked at was attached with a script, their choices mapped out like chess moves. He would watch a woman reach for an umbrella and know, someone behind her would steal her purse. He&#39;d see a man approach a crosswalk and understand that the man would be hit by a car as he crossed, leading to his death. Everywhere he went he saw calamity, and of course it was written by the universe. It only got worse as the days went on, his visions becoming darker, leading Jason down pitfalls of depression, and most horrifyingly, self harm and suicide. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only when he confronted the unconventional and diluted psychologist who lived next door to him, an elderly woman in her 70&rsquo;s who had apparently gotten a PhD in psychology. His deficiency in sleeping and mental hallucinations forced him to crawl to the very footsteps of her door, begging the witch-like nature of her to suggest any method to cure him. Her name was Ms Umbrack, unmarried with a strange appearance. Ragged red hair accompanied her swampy green eyes that laced in venom, her voice sounding something straight out of a horror film.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re that measly man who lives next door right?&rdquo; she scowled, her voice in excitement as she saw Jason trembling in terror. He sat upright in her vintage chair, inhaling a sharp, pungent aroma of rotting and smoking wood that choked him internally. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes&hellip;&rdquo; Jason whimpered. Surprisingly, the visions had stopped for a moment, for he couldn&rsquo;t see the visions affecting the woman. She had no fate whatsoever, and he couldn&rsquo;t predict it. For once, he didn&rsquo;t feel guilty for not being able to save someone from their fate. It was the universe&rsquo;s rule after all, but who didn&rsquo;t want to change the terrifying effects of fate? He certainly didn&rsquo;t want to die. The disease was already feeling cosmical, something that wasn&rsquo;t supposed to originate from this world. Her home was cozy to say the least, with strange signage and branding of some sort of paranormal organisation, namely branded as the International Supernatural Intelligence Division.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Did you get a new job?&rdquo; Jason asked out of curiosity, noticing the black and purple logo decorate her living room. Ms. Umbrack laughed louder this time, pointing at Jason as he wondered innocently about the strange company she was engrossed in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not really, but I help them. There&rsquo;s ghosts in this world if ya don&rsquo;t believe me. Anything can become a living nightmare!&rdquo; Ms. Umbrack assured, her laugh slowly turning into a more serious statement that began to haunt Jason again. Anything could turn into monsters? Creepy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go to this address, the man here can help ya! He&rsquo;s treated me before so I&rsquo;m certain he can cure you!&rdquo; Ms. Umbrack cackled, handing him a worn out, almost torn card with a suspicious address. It was far north, somewhere isolated in a town he did not know of. It was already giving an ominous vibe, and the longer he stared at the address, the more pressure he felt. Either he had to go, or not. Even so, Ms. Umbrack had a bizarre charm that made Jason feel like she was right, and that perhaps if he wanted to never dream of death again, he had to trust her and just go.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In desperation, Jason found himself on a nightmarishly long drive up north and through the uncharted forest, into the thick crevice of woods that led him to the two towns along a large winding river that seemed to end just further north upstream. He didn&rsquo;t stop there, he continued strong into the town, wandering to the front gate of the mansion that loomed over his tiny figure. The spiked fence that surrounded the distinct building wrangled amongst the overgrown bushes, poking at Jason&rsquo;s body. He whispered to himself that it was going to be another nightmare he had to endure, and the hallucinations would only stop if he continued forward into the bizarre mansion. The cobbled path that led towards the grand front doors wasn&rsquo;t scary in a sense, rather quite steep for the mansion was built on a small hill. The matured wooden frames were visible cracks as Jason carefully knocked on the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been&hellip;expecting you&hellip;&rdquo; the voice echoed, the ominous undertone carrying through the small opening between the doors. It sunk into Jason as if he had just seen a ghost, his expression growing pale by the second. What came after was a violent tug that dragged him into the darkness of the mansion, his body shrieking in fear as the firm hand grasped onto his fragile neck. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do come this way,&rdquo; the voice guided. &ldquo;You might know me as Dr. Chess, please, take a seat, this will only take a while to set up,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jason felt around the dimmed room, finally seeing a candle light up the shady desk where an enigmatic chess set was carefully laid out in front of him. He looked dumbfounded as he inspected the board, wondering if the doctor was a real doctor. He questioned his ability and his medical skills, unable to see any surgical instruments or tools laying around. All that he saw was an unorganised and chaotic room, full of random items that reeked of a putrid scent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you sure you can&hellip;cure me?&rdquo; Jason asked, his voice shrivelling. Again, his breath hitched and vision stuttered, but it immediately fixated on the doctor. There were no illusions, but a clear vision of the doctor in his sight. It felt like the instance with Ms Umbrack again, but with the doctor. Were they not humans? The doctor quietly strolled over towards the countertop, retrieving a pen and paper. He sat down calmly as he toyed with the chess pieces, making sure they were ready to be played with. Each piece, meticulously placed, in order to adjust the chaos was finally set. The two kings stared each other down at the ends of the board, ready to determine a fate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know how to play the game?&rdquo; the doctor asked sternly, still masking his face. The obscured view made Jason even harder to corporate, unable to get him to agree with anything. If anything, Jason was suspicious, trembling with fear as they did not trust the doctor in any way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jason replied hesitantly, his voice stuttering on the last beat. His tone dropped as the doctor moved his A pawn forward. Jason was confused, playing the way he would play. The doctor&rsquo;s next moves were predictable, as his visions guided him to the doctor&rsquo;s next move. Each hallucination made the logic and process of the doctor&rsquo;s thinking clearer, allowing Jason to penetrate his defense, tactically winning pieces.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oops,&rdquo; the doctor exclaimed, noticing his apparent mistake. His next move was to counter Jason&rsquo;s invasive queen, for it had taken his A file rook. Each move, all intricate, set the tone of the board. Grim, uneasy and most notably, wrong. As Jason took the final piece left on the doctor&rsquo;s side apart from the king being the queen, he was ready to deliver the checkmate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you ever heard of the fog of war theory?&rdquo; the doctor asked. Jason was suddenly thrusted upright, something banging on his head had recentered his mind to refocus on the changed chess board. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s messing with how you see the board,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Somehow, the chess board was different. Instead, the board was even, the doctor down only a few pieces with most of his important pieces still intact.The abstract background almost spoke to Jason, whispering to him of his defeat. As his eyes darted around the room to inspect if it was a supernatural occurrence or paranormal activity that triggered this reversal, he couldn&rsquo;t find anything but antiques laying on the benches and counters inside the mansion. It was a complete mess and yet, the only thing that was in order was the board in front of him. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; the doctor said in anticipation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your move.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice was tense, as if he was concerned about Jason. But all Jason could think about was beating the doctor at chess, believing it was a test of wit. He knew that his visions were aiding him in seeing his very next moves, giving him a single, predetermined path that assured his victory. But still, he was blind to the fog the doctor operated in. He still didn&rsquo;t see the already evident supernatural chess board, playing as if he could see the doctor&rsquo;s next move. In fact, he was moving pieces into the abyss, creating the possible outcome of him horrifically losing. Jason carefully and confidently slid his bishop up 3 squares the next move, attacking the doctor&rsquo;s king. Check. The grandfather clock in the hallway chimed perfectly in time with Jason&rsquo;s move as if it predicted his move, out manoeuvring the contagious disease that had begun to overthrow his mind. As a result, Jason became paranoid, his expression now beginning to lace in terror as he watched the doctor&rsquo;s scornful expression turn even more grim at the hand of his next move. The doctor, not impressed, rolled his eyes as he moved his king to safety. The following moves Jason performed always attacked the side the king was on, pressuring the doctor to play more defensive than offensive, limiting to what he could play. At that moment, Jason felt a resurgence of hope shimmering in his heart, his next move demanding of rigour and perfection. He shifted his queen forward three tiles, capturing the pawn, creating a queen sacrifice. The doctor leapt forward, not in terror or shock, but in joy. A small chuckle disturbed the unnatural silence there was in the room, removing the illusion again on the board. Jason, struck in confusion again, looked around frantically again just to notice a wooden hourglass sat on an antique cabinet had just finished a cycle, realising this wasn&rsquo;t a normal game of chess. It wasn&rsquo;t a test, game or any type of cure, the doctor had challenged Jason with the sole purpose to entertain himself. Was it because he lived alone? It was a possibility Jason definitely considered, and it did sound plausible due to the mansion standing alone in such a remote location. As Jason stood up, the doctor&rsquo;s formalities returned abruptly, interrupting his frustration.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Something wrong?&rdquo; the doctor asked, this time his voice had reversed back into a calm, neutral and nourishing tone that sounded like he actually cared about Jason. It all felt too chaotic for him as he tried to walk into the other rooms, just for a strange sensation to chill him, forcing him back into the confines of the claustrophobic room with the chess board. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Jason took a deep breath, he prepared his final attack to checkmate the doctor with the guidance of his vision. As he glided the unnaturally cold bishop across the board, the doctor&rsquo;s old and veiny hands reached for Jason&rsquo;s king, knocking it over. Thonk. The king fell over in slow motion, the edges blurring as Jason watched the descent of the king onto his lap. He had lost? Impossible, he would have seen the doctor&rsquo;s next move. Suddenly, another vibration caught Jason&rsquo;s attention, striking him in his heart this time. His stomach gurgled at the ever so sinister interior atmosphere, lurching forward at the sight of the pinewood gramophone, for it echoed the chess game back at Jason.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A4, E5, nC3, D5, E4, nF6&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The moves were strikingly different, for the game seemed to be an illusion of fate. It was a game fate was never meant to see or understand. Suddenly, the gramophone churned into limbs, the hourglass from before modelling a head alongside the grandfather clock floating towards the room, depicted that of a body. Jason watched in horror as the phantasmal beast was formed by the supernatural antiques. What kind of collector was this doctor? He had such strange contraptions hidden in his house, and he couldn&#39;t even fathom how he even managed to cure others like Ms Umbrack. His mind began to blur, shapes distorting and warping into messes his eyes couldn&rsquo;t start perceiving. The only thing that was sharp and in focus was the laser calm doctor, sitting quietly in his seat not batting an eye. His sweat trickled down his next as Jason stumbled towards the floor, grasping onto the chair leg to maintain his balance. He was losing it. The visions felt like overwhelming control. He couldn&rsquo;t begin to imagine that this supernatural event was going to be his death.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say this once, because you&rsquo;re one of the first patients who have failed this game,&rdquo; the doctor began. &ldquo;What you have just played wasn&rsquo;t a normal game of chess, it&rsquo;s the chess board from the mechanical turk infused with something called cosmic energy,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jason squirmed around on the floor, rolling aimlessly as he tried to rid his mind of visions. He tried to listen, but he couldn&rsquo;t focus on any of the words the doctor had said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see, if you follow fate, you&rsquo;re following the universe and the universe can thrust anything upon you,&rdquo; the doctor continued. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t slaves of fate if we choose free will,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Doctor&hellip;&rdquo; Jason huffed. His exhaustion became clear and his panic had shot through the roof. His eyes were widening, bulging even with his scarlet veins forcing themselves on to the edges of the sclera. &ldquo;Help me from this absolute carnage&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Jason&rsquo;s visions became more and more opaque as it began to tread near him, its wooden body interacting with the environment. The doctor remained silent. What Ms. Umbrack had said </span><span>before was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;indeed true. Anything could really become his worst nightmare. He would never have imagined to trust the old hag, but he was dead for not understanding the existence and horrific nature of the supernatural. What was this, the working of the organisation she had helped? No, it couldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please!&rdquo; Jason begged, his voice wailing in desperation. He felt the wooden beast carve a chunk of flesh from his chest, hearing the calming sound of his own blood trickling out. &ldquo;I thought&hellip;you&hellip;cured&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And there he sat, not saying a word as the vision suddenly leapt inside Jason, merging with his already concurrent chaotic hallucinations. At that moment, his sudden realisation formed, concluding that the antiques must have been filled with the cosmic energy the doctor had previously mentioned. As he tried to speak, begging at the doctor, his own words began violently eating his brain. Was his loss at chess a mistake? No, it wasn&rsquo;t, the doctor had outplayed fate. He predicted fate. Jason couldn&rsquo;t make his own choice, he lacked the courage to move himself. The hideous scene exposed the horrific innards that gashed out along the wooden floorboards as his skin peeled backwards adjacent to his rapidly decaying muscles. His heart throbbled onto the floor, still alive and pulsating as purple energy erupted from the arteries. The cosmic energy finally began to erode away, at the same time breaking his heart physically apart. His lungs explosively burst out, instantly crumpling, leaving the floor stained with an even darker crimson red. It was already reeking, a coiled mess of organs and pale liquid now oozing out grotesquely. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I couldn&rsquo;t cure you,&rdquo; the doctor replied. The room instantly reverted back, the mess of chess pieces and broken antiques hovering back into their original positions. The mansion itself was alive. Respectfully, he took off the shadows that covered his unshaved face by turning on the ultraviolet lights, revealing the overgrown beard he had alongside the disfigured mouth he had. His teeth were mismatched, gold and white with the letters A, V and K engraved on the top row of his front teeth. He carefully took out a fresh business card, then waved it in front of the dead body, mocking Jason of his inability to take free will. He had accepted fate, and the last thing he saw was the name of the doctor, engraved on the business card, Aamon Von K&rsquo;hess, of the International Supernatural Intelligence Division.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.s1neaarcx7ih"><span class="c3">III - Ajespa&rsquo;s Acrimony</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The stars shone like clusters of crystals in the pitch-black sky, slowly flickering ever so brightly. The midnight scent was fresh, with a hint of rainwater. The breeze gently brushed against her lavender hair, as she walked down the streets of Ajespa, the city that never slept.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ajespa thrived on its nightlife, providing residents with numerous nightclubs, delicious street food vendors, 24/7 arcades, and other amazing services. Along with the serene landscapes and dazzling flowers in the daytime, Ajespa was almost like a fantasy world, lingering with otherworldly atmospheres. Yet, she felt alone in the dream-like city. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The miraculous city built in just 19 years out of nothing was truly a feat for mankind. What started as a mere shelter turned into a vibrant cityscape, with buildings piercing the sky and shops of various goods. But Rae didn&#39;t think much of this feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She trudged along the footpath up towards the mountaintop, climbing towards the peak that loomed over the valley. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah, there you are...Rae Lioni. Your father says dinner is ready...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She silently sat on the cliff&#39;s edge and smiled, unfazed that she was half dangling off the cliff. The view of the valley allowed her to see the suburban areas of the city, where she had come from. The sound of the waterfall beneath her slowly filled the silence as the water rushed out, creating a calming sensation that soothed her mind of all negativities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Barton, why can&#39;t I go explore the world?&quot; Rae began. She toyed with her hair, as the gentle evening breeze sent a cold and fuzzy feeling inside her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, do you keep forgetting? You are the princess of Ajespa, you must continue the legacy...to protect our sacred kingdom!&quot; Barton exclaimed. Rae had nothing to say to Barton&#39;s statement and remained in solitude, listening to the ambience.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to go for a walk,&quot; Rae sighed, standing up. &quot;Tell Father that I won&#39;t be there for dinner,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae was alone in such a big city. Even with the most advanced technology, she couldn&#39;t find anyone in person or online who would listen to her or be willing to befriend her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Princess! What are you doing here?&quot; the locals asked as Rae passed the food stalls, down the main road. Rae didn&#39;t reply, for she disliked the amount of publicity she had as the princess. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The streets were busy as usual, the flickering of neon signs and holographic text, igniting the paradise. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Rae couldn&#39;t help to notice one thing; a rather odd symbol almost stamped on all the large cardboard boxes that were filled with goods. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What company is supplying this?&quot; Rae asked a merchant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Great question! I don&#39;t know!&quot; the merchant replied happily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Good one! M&#39;lady, the company is called Anateros,&quot; a voice spoke. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah! Anateros!&quot; the merchant added. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sounds sketchy...&quot; Rae remarked, crossing her arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you going to do? Report us to security? Oh wait...there isn&#39;t any here!&quot; the merchant laughed. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, just wait!&quot; Rae snapped, walking away. She grabbed her phone and jumped onto the internet search bar, her fingers frantically typing the words: &quot;Private Investigation&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The engine produced millions of results at lightning speed, but one at the top immediately caught her eye. No, there was no mistake. She knew she had been searching bizarre things on the internet but for something to be this personal, Rae knew exactly what the service could do to her. There it was, on the page, the American Supernatural Intelligence Division.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae quickly snapped a few photos of the streets and then rushed home, filling out the form for a case. She had high hopes that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime to find out the secrets that the city had.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias Novem was bored. Elias stared at the mundane white ceiling of his apartment, laying on his bed peacefully. The ASID wasn&#39;t kind enough to give Elias many cases, and having a long drought of cases, Elias was ecstatic when his phone vibrated a light green; it signalled to him that Tom had called. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias! I&#39;m here to assign you to your next case. Our top detectives are all busy working together on another case; hence we need you to solve this case!&quot; Tom laughed. &quot;It&#39;s in Georgia, we&#39;ll send you the details!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Before Elias could begin and put together his thoughts, Tom had hung up and all Elias could hear was the silent static that rang in his ear. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A red notification bubble suddenly alerted Elias upright once again, with the contents containing a single PDF file. Elias, hesitant to accept the case, opened the file to view the contents.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The file introduced Ajespa, the city of wonder and Elias was hooked immediately. The photos present were bright and colourful, radiating with energy and hinting at an uneasy feeling of modernism. Elias rang Tom again, now standing up and changing into his navy jacket, excited to finally go on a case again. Elias was ready for adventure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Tom demanded with an arrogant tone. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;When&#39;s my flight?&quot; Elias questioned, a grin appearing on his face. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Tomorrow morning, 8 am. Get some rest kid,&quot; Tom replied calmly, then hung up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~ </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias finally reached Ajespa, where the commotion was high, and the mysteries were unsolved. What appeared as mountains to the naked eye, Elias recognised as a complex of mazes, marked by man-made signs that hinted at ancient ruins. He wandered the streets of Ajespa like a boy in a candy store; it was like a dreamland. It was too good to be true.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Jeez, who&#39;s the client? And what is this mystery?&quot; Elias thought to himself. Gazing at his surroundings, Elias witnessed several merchant stores and fresh food markets, tucked away in the open ground floor of the towering skyscrapers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Get fresh meat for only 200 Lari!&quot; a vendor announced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are those absurd prices?&quot; Elias commented, throwing his hands up in disbelief. He approached the vendor to confront him about the prices. The vendor was a stout man with a wide grin, wiping his hands on an apron stained from a day&#39;s work. His stall was filled with an array of meats, wrapped in wax paper, organised neatly into four evenly spaced rows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Two hundred Lari for meat? You do know people aren&#39;t made of money, right?&quot; Elias said, folding his arms as he stared down the merchant. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The merchant didn&#39;t flinch. Instead, he chuckled, looking Elias up and down. &quot;What are you, a foreigner? These prices are normal! We get these quality meats from Anateros!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anateros?&quot; Elias questioned. &quot;What is that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t even know of Anateros?&quot; the vendor scoffed, leaning forward. He stared down Elias, sending a terrible shiver down his spine that spooked him to the core. The vendor pointed towards the machine in the back, specifically at the logo that was engraved into the machine. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The structure was composed of two triangular shapes: a small, compact one and a tall, slender one, arranged side-by-side to convey strength and precision. &quot;Let me give you a quick history lesson, newbie. Anateros is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and they are the cornerstone of this city. Without them, we would be broken into pieces!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias sighed, turned away, and trudged down the bustling streets, only to notice the same logo everywhere he went. It was stuck in his head, with the imbalance of symmetry sparking new ideas in his head. Was this company the cornerstone of the city? What are their true motivations? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anateros...sounds Greek-ish...&quot; Elias mumbled, focusing on his thoughts. Elias was lost in his logic and kept walking forward, slowly losing focus on his way forward and tilting his head down to concentrate. The rhythmic beat of his footsteps only helped him sink deeper into his tangled state of mind, with his eyes tracing the ground.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the sudden ambience of his footsteps stopped abruptly, Elias felt a strong impact on his body, pushing him backwards. He found himself face-to-face with someone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, quickly passing by Elias. Elias was wonderstruck. That lavender hair and that scarlet silk dress were an enchanting sight for Elias. He had first not seen a woman that beautiful in his life, and second of all, it came to his realisation that she was the princess of Ajespa, the heir to the throne, part of the royal family.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Wait a moment!&quot; Elias shouted, quickly turning around. The girl froze and looked behind her to see Elias gazing deep into her eyes. A warm sensation coursed through her, and a mysterious aura drew her closer to Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My name is Elias Novem, pleased to meet you, princess,&quot; Elias began. &quot;I&#39;ve been tasked by someone from this city for a private investigation?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re the one they sent?&quot; the princess stumbled. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, I have been tasked by the American Supernatural Intelligence Division to come investigate the city of Ajespa,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Please call me Rae,&quot; Rae replied. &quot;And I was the one who asked you to come...there&#39;s been a lot happening recently...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read on the news...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Follow me. I want to show you something...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae ascended the mountain along the footpath to Ajespan Manor, the royal family&#39;s estate. The garden was beautiful, especially during the evening as the sun had cast long beams of light that emphasised the colours of the flowers. The moment Elias stepped into the manor, an unseen, majestic energy enveloped him. It was a mystical aura that filled his mind with wonder. The interior was quite spacious and grandeur, although not matching the futuristic style of the rest of the city, it was littered with vintage items and paintings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Your father is sick Rae. And who&#39;s this fine gentleman?&quot; the butler asked from the second floor, spotting Rae and Elias entering the manor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I made a friend, Barton!&quot; Rae exclaimed. Elias was confused, as he was only just a detective on a case and didn&#39;t consider himself a friend of Rae, especially when he knew that she didn&#39;t have any friends.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I see...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;His name is Elias...Would father mind if he stayed for the night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh well, I suppose. After all, I&#39;m just a butler, following your father&#39;s orders,&quot; Barton explained. Soon after, he left the room, leaving Elias and Rae alone in the manor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m going to first change out of this dress, it&#39;s a mess,&quot; Rae smiled as she slipped into her room, changing into something more comfortable. It wasn&#39;t long until she was back out and ready to show Elias the bizarre tunnel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, um,&quot; Rae mumbled, swaying from left to right. Elias immediately knew she was quite nervous, slowly moving towards the left side of the manor as if she were trying to direct him. He casually followed Rae&#39;s lead towards a locked door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Since I was young, my dad has never let me through this door. I&#39;ve been so curious for the past few years, so I&#39;ve tried many times, but I&#39;ve been caught,&quot; Rae explained as she picked the lock on the door. Elias watched with worry as he knew if one&#39;s daughter was picking a lock, it was not a good sign of the future. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Anyway, this is the perfect time! Father is sick so we can explore where the door leads. I need help solving this mystery. I can&#39;t do it alone; I need someone smart like you!&quot; Rae smiled, opening the door as she finished her last words. &quot;There! Let&#39;s go...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they stepped inside, a heavy but gentle gust of air brushed their cheeks, sending a chilling sensation down their spines. Each step they took sent an uneasy tingling feeling into their bodies as the hallway became narrower, they went down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Look at these carvings...&quot; Elias whispered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know right? It&#39;s so magical!&quot; Rae replied, giggling a little.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The passageway began to slope downward, subtly at first, then more pronounced, and the air grew colder still. Rae saw it first; the hallway had ended right beneath their feet, and it marked the entrance of the dungeons. The sound of dripping water suddenly began echoing from above and Elias almost immediately spotted bones, giving him the chills.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This is ancient Georgia, eh?&quot; Elias remarked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I believe so. This is so cool!&quot; Rae smiled. Soon, they reached an intersection with two doors on either side of the hallway. The left door, forbidding entry with a stern &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign, was firmly locked. However, the right door, bare of any warning, was not locked. Rae slowly pushed the door on the right open and revealed the ominous interior.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The room was hollowed out, stretching to the vast size of the mountain&#39;s interior. Inside, nine giant mutant-like robots were neatly organised into a three-by-three grid, each looking like they were built yesterday. There were computers, and tools that lay around on the ground, scattered like a mad sea. Rae and Elias were both frozen in motion, like a stone statue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias had read stories of long-lost technologies, but to see them here, in the catacombs of Georgia, silent and unmoving, was surreal. Each robot loomed over him like a metal sentinel, waiting in eternal slumber. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae approached the robot and reached out, her fingers grazing the cold silver. It felt almost alive as if she were touching something ancient, forbidden. Elias moved beside her, his eyes wide with fear and awe. For a moment, neither of them spoke. There was an unseen magical force that suddenly pressed against them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The emptiness of the room seemed to breathe around them, shadows shifting as the faint glow of their flashlights skimmed across hulking metal figures. Although there were nine robots in the room, each of them seemed to be gigantic, roughly about eight times larger than a normal human. They were all encased in layers of silver plating, still shining like it was polished a minute ago. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias carefully weaved through the robots, his hand brushing the cold metal of a robot&#39;s arm. The bulky arms of the robots were cold and hard, knocking them sent a low vibration that echoed through the room. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile, Rae took an unconscious step back, the awe in her eyes mingling with a trace of fear. Rae was lost in her thoughts as she gazed at the huge robots. She closely inspected them and found guns attached to their backs and more firearms mounted into their arms. Rae began finding the robots more like war robots.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias quickly scanned the room as he reached the other end and approached a small table in the corner. He began searching the tabletop, reaching for the opened book that lay flat on the table, flipping through its contents. He used his phone as an aid to translate passages to help him understand. The task was arduous, and Elias was devoted to learning something new about the mystery. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, footsteps echoed down the narrow needle-like hallways of the catacombs, slowly forming an ominous atmosphere cloaked with mystery. Elias quickly snapped photos of the pages and stood beside Rae.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are we going to do now?&quot; Rae asked. &quot;What if they come here?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There!&quot; Elias murmured sharply, with his finger pointing to a small, unassuming wooden door hidden in the shadows at the far end of the room. Without hesitation, the two sprinted across the room towards the door, tugging it open and slipping inside before quickly pulling it shut behind them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The footsteps grew louder as the mysterious figure entered the room, now scanning the area. Rae carefully leaned back and gently pressed against Elias&#39;s body. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Elias whispered, wrapping his hand around Rae&#39;s body as he tried to steady his heartbeat. She nodded, exhaling in relief as they stood perfectly still.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmph,&quot; the figure muttered in a frustrated tone. They then marched out of the room. Elias peered through the cracks, catching a glimpse of the figure as he left. He identified the figure as a tall, thin man in a dark shirt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae struggled for a while but slowly managed to crawl out of the cramped storage room. The two gathered all the information and headed out of the devilish room of robots, and back into the tunnels of the catacombs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go back,&quot; Rae mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hang on, I need to check something. Go on ahead without me, I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; Elias motioned as he approached the locked door. Rae quickly moved on by herself while Elias inspected the &quot;Do Not Enter&quot; sign much closer, and quickly realised the passkey to the lock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias had realised the combination was a 4-digit code and figured that the number of strokes each word had must have related to the password. Elias quickly counted the strokes and swiftly dialled the code &#39;4616&#39; into the rusty lock. The lock was uneasy to configure, with the numbers getting stuck easily but Elias powered through, and finally, the door magically opened.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias gently leaned against the door and carefully pushed it open, unveiling an egg-like capsule in the middle of the room. His gaze fell upon a tattered book page, discarded on the floor. The remaining words displayed:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;For he searched.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The essence of the.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And we did advance like.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cultivating technology.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Burned us together;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias thought hard, ultimately resulting in him snapping a photo and leaving, not wanting anything to happen to Rae. Elias quickly rushed out of the room and realised Rae was long gone and was out of his sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae!&quot; Elias called out, echoing through the tunnels. Elias gracefully found his way out, back into the manor. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Looking for the girl, Novem?&quot; a voice crackled. Elias turned to see the man approaching him in his adorned black suit, walking with fashion towards him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You...You aren&#39;t a royal...You&#39;re just a butler!&quot; Elias started, jerking backwards and positioning himself into a better stance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Of course, the Royal Family are just puppets of mine. This city, what you are seeing is just a fraction of my wealth!&quot; the butler laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Anateros is where I&#39;ll start disassembling your wealth,&quot; Elias snapped, slowly backing away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh? Getting your hopes up high, I see.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I already know everything!&quot; Elias exclaimed. &quot;This is just the beginning, and I will take you down...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias pushed the doors open of the manor and stepped outside, finally able to catch his breath. He sighed a deep sigh of relief and quickly regained his energy, then stood up and read over his notes again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opening his notes app, Elias carefully analysed his findings. &quot;Strange robots are hidden in catacombs. According to history, in 1551, the Persians invaded Vardzia, where Ajespa stood. Unless the Georgians had hidden something here...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A sudden realisation ignited in Elias&#39;s mind as if a match had struck him aflame. Returning to the passage, Elias finally deciphered its meaning, discovering that the Georgians had hidden a treasure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Now if I can just find Rae...&quot; Elias muttered, contemplating whether he should barge back into the manor. Elias decided to play it cool and waited, hiding in the nearby bushes. Soon enough the butler stepped outside the manor, checking his surroundings then jumping into a car.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go to Vroti Tower,&quot; the butler commanded. The chauffeur nodded, starting the car. As he drove, Elias strained to hear the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias arrived at the tower soon after, holding a sinking feeling throughout his journey. The tower certainly felt like a trap and Elias was weary of it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Help me...&quot; a voice rang. A slight tapping of glass echoed from above, followed by a sudden static whirring noise alarmed Elias, who jolted backwards at the flickering of the screen. The massive screen in the lobby suddenly turned on, with the butler&#39;s face on it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello Novem, looks like we have met again. What a sneaky little rat you are!&quot; the butler laughed. &quot;So, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve seen the War robots, eh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; Elias sputtered, reassembling his thoughts completely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Those robots underground, in the catacombs! Don&#39;t lie, I can smell that scent from you! They will soon rise and help Anateros become a more powerful company!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So, I assumed...&quot; Elias smirked, grinning. He was unfazed by the impending doom and pieced together the puzzle in his mind, now with his logic all cleared and actions unclouded. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ha! As if you&#39;re a superhero!&quot; the butler laughed hysterically. He quickly turned off the camera that displayed his face and switched it to a different view of two cameras pointing at two distinct subjects.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I know you&#39;ve come to like the royal, so let&#39;s play a game, Novem,&quot; the butler giggled. The screen was split into two, with the first camera pointing towards Rae, being tied up by the hands. The camera panned down, pointing towards Elias who gazed up and saw Rae just a few floors above him. The other camera pointed towards a big red button, and the butler soon entered the frame. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The girl? Or will you save the city? This button awakens my newest creations!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias hesitated, not knowing which option to choose. He knew he couldn&#39;t be the hero and perform both tasks; No, it was either Rae or the city. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Too late!&quot; the butler yelled. &quot;Cut it!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man swiftly cut the rope holding Rae up and she began falling. Then, the butler slammed the button hard with his fist. Elias didn&#39;t have a choice but to save Rae. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias gracefully caught Rae as she descended, falling and hitting hard on his arms. &quot;Oof! Are you alright?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Argh, I&#39;m fine...&quot; Rae groaned. Rae got on her feet again and Elias helped her out of the building.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A deafening whirring sound began to stir up as they stepped foot outside the Vroti Tower and what the two saw shocked them. The ground, the streets, and the land began to split in half and open into a giant enormous cave underneath them, unveiling a giant army of metal war robots.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Behold! The creations of the wisest civilisation, the Georgians! Bring me power, war robots!&quot; the butler shouted as he stood on the top floor of the Vroti tower. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Barton Colerico...&quot; Rae muttered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s his name?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No wonder...That man has been America&#39;s most wanted for decades now...appearing on hundreds of headlines...&quot; Elias explained. &quot;He is a true mastermind...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Barton&#39;s laughter echoed through the tower, Rae&#39;s heart began to pound faster, matching the rhythm of the chaos surrounding her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The robots suddenly produced a deep and ominous grunt, shaking the very Earth and scaring the residents. The robots began hunting the residents like tiny ants, stomping on them and destroying nearby buildings; all but except the Vroti Tower.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae, we need to move!&quot; Elias&#39;s voice was strained, but she hesitated, glancing back at Barton. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Try to run! It will not be much longer until I gain control of the world!&quot; Barton roared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae gripped Elias&#39;s hand tightly, and together, they dashed for the exit as the ground trembled. Metal fragments sprayed past them, a relentless wave of heat and force. Rae stumbled, her chest heaving, each step pulling her farther from the only life she had ever known and closer to an uncertain future.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Aaah!&quot; Rae screamed as an arm flailed across her eyes. The war robots slowly awakened, their mechanical limbs creaking as they rose to infest the city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;To the castle!&quot; Elias shouted as he found an empty car parked on the side. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Do you even know how to drive?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Relax! I got my licence 3 months ago!&quot; Surprisingly, no war robots attempted to get in Elias&#39;s way, and they casually made it to the castle without any incidents. The war robots acted as if there was a repellent on them, guiding them away from him. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This is so strange...&quot; Elias remarked, looking back down at the city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae! There you are!&quot; a voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dad? You&#39;re awake?&quot; Rae stuttered, unable to piece her words together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;There&#39;s something I need to tell you. I always knew this day would come; I didn&#39;t expect it to arrive so soon. It&#39;s the end of the world...&quot; Rae&#39;s father began.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What is it, Dad? Dad? Randall?&quot; Rae asked, now extremely eager.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m not your father. And I can&#39;t say if you are adopted or not...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae&#39;s heart suddenly skipped a beat. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen! After the fateful invasion in 1551, my family was tasked to guard and research the area. We&#39;ve been the guardians of this place. After discovering the war robots, we wanted to restore them to see what they could do. But none of us were capable. That&#39;s why, 31 years ago we asked mastermind Barton Colerico to help us fix these robots.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I get it!&quot; Elias interrupted. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He said it would cost a fortune to fix...&quot; Randall continued.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And that&#39;s why Ajespa&#39;s merchants have such overpriced goods! They must all be working for Anateros!&quot; Elias realised.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Correct. For you Rae, Barton found you in a peculiar egg hidden away in the depths of the catacombs...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dad...I...&quot; Rae began, panicking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Elias whispered, placing his hand on her shoulder, trying to calm her down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;He brought you here, and we took care of you. We didn&#39;t know what to do with you, so we just cared for you...Oh, now we left Barton in charge of the robots...We strayed too far, and he took control...How foolish I am...&quot; Randall signed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re missing something...&quot; Elias hesitated. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If Rae was found in the catacombs, and was in that egg thing...She has been alive for over 3 centuries...The Georgians were known for their wisdom, and after what I saw of the egg, it&#39;s like a cryonic device, allowing Rae to be transferred to the future...&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Randall interrupted, now intrigued. He gazed into Elias&#39;s midnight black eyes, flawlessly deciphering the century-long mystery. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m saying Rae is a descendant of the Georgians and could have the ability to control the robots. Think about it! Their wisdom rivals modern technology. Who knows if they have voice commands or something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae, try it! You must help us stop this madness Barton is doing!&quot; Randall begged.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The truth is, Rae is technically the queen of Georgia. If I&#39;m not wrong, the war robots were supposed to be designed as bodyguards that would protect her and free her from her century-long cryofreeze, but they were never finished. Instead, Barton had continued the Persian&#39;s work, freed Rae and altered the robots&#39; code.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ok...okay...&quot; Rae replied, catching her breath. Rae&#39;s heart hammered in her chest at a high tempo, with the echo of the beat seeming louder than the mechanical hum surrounding her. How were these machines supposed to be bodyguards? Rae felt the heavy weight of burdens the Georgians carried on her shoulders, as if her ancestors watched, waiting to see what the future queen would do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae looked down at her hands, then at Elias&#39;s eyes. Again, she saw only death in his eyes, but she knew that he had something special about him. Rae had never felt anything like this, and trusting in Elias was something hard for her to swallow. She quickly directed her attention back towards the robots and inhaled deeply, channelling her strength from a place she didn&#39;t know existed, and prepared to speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To their surprise, there was a long delay, then silence. The city fell quiet, and the robots stopped the loud whirring noise and froze in motion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What? What happened?&quot; Barton exclaimed in utter disbelief, leaning over the edge of the Vroti tower to see the chaos unfold. &quot;Why did they stop?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey Rae, what if you asked them to get Barton Colerico?&quot; Elias suggested, smiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae blushed, nodded and went through with Elias&#39;s idea. Again, shouting at the top of her lungs, Rae commanded the robots. &quot;Get me Barton Colerico!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The robots scanned the area, finding Barton Colerico. The closest robot leaned down towards Barton and plucked him like a cherry. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey! Let go of me! Argh!&quot; Barton squirmed. The machine marched towards Rae and threw him in front of her. This was a miraculous moment as peace and silence engulfed the whole city. Barton sprawled at Rae&#39;s feet, his expression twisting between anger and shock. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ugh...screw your royalty! I knew I shouldn&#39;t have freed you from that stupid egg...&quot; Barton whimpered as he struggled to get up, </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re coming with me back to the States, buddy. You got a $500 million bounty on your head!&quot; Elias laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You think I&#39;m going down that easily?&quot; Barton laughed with his last breath. Then, like a cruel twist of fate, his hand slipped to his jacket, pulling out the small device as his lips curled into a smirk. &quot;You may have solved this case, but it will cost you your life...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a very subtle beeping sound at first, with Elias not even noticing. The sound gradually grew louder and louder until Rae heard it and pulled Elias towards her. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A thunderous roar, hellish red fire and chunks of metal began spewing everywhere and one by one, the robots began to detonate, erupting and breaking apart. There was nothing but explosions. Rae, Elias, and Randall barely had time to dive for cover as the force of the explosions had sent large chunks of debris sky-high, piercing the ground as they came flying down. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Larry! Bring down the chopper! Get me out of here!&quot; Barton yelled into his earpiece.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias, Rae and Randall ran for cover as Barton ran towards the cliff&#39;s edge, swiftly jumping on the helicopter his men were piloting. &quot;We&#39;ll meet again, Elias!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias gave Barton a dirty look as he ran for cover. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three quickly made their way to the manor&#39;s walls, estimating it was probably the safest place to take cover. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Elias&#39;s phone rang. Elias picked up the phone as he watched the city skyline crumble, each tower and building slowly disintegrating right in front of him. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Novem, this is Sylvester from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division! I&#39;ve picked up some unusual activity near your location. Where on earth did Tom send you this time? Do you need a ride back? It looks like you are in a nuke zone now,&quot; the agent warned, his voice laced with urgency.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, and please hurry up!&quot; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yep! We have a speed jet on its way from Zestafoni that landed for a research project a couple of hours ago. It&#39;ll be there in about 5 minutes!&quot; The line hung up and Elias cleaned up his thoughts, thinking of what to do next.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;At least the city of lies is gone...&quot; Randall smiled as the city slowly crumbled, leaving only the ancient natural terrain behind. He leant against the brick wall of the manor, as a tear fell from his eyes. &quot;Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes Dad, I love you...&quot; Rae cried, holding him tight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Rae darling...I think it&#39;s time you left the chains Vardzia and Georgia hold you...I know you aren&#39;t capable of this position, and I think everyone should learn the true history of the Georgians, here in Vardzia. It&#39;s time for you to explore the world. Who knows what you&#39;ll encounter?&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really?&quot; Rae sniffed. She couldn&#39;t hold her tears back anymore and started weeping, crying on her old man&#39;s shoulder. She looked into his eyes, the familiar kindness and strength that had always anchored her, and for a moment, the weight she carried faded. Randall smiled and kissed her on the forehead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, Barton has only been feeding you lies. The world now is so much better than it was 3 centuries ago. It&#39;s okay, I have always loved you,&quot; Randall smiled, his eyes softening. &quot;You were always destined for more, Rae. Vardzia may be your birthplace, but the world beyond awaits you. Go live it fully, for me, for your ancestors. Elias will help you; he seems like such a sweet boy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Randall!&quot; another voice shouted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maria! Come on, hurry! You&#39;re going to die!&quot; Randall shouted. &quot;C&#39;mon, I promise we&#39;ll be here the next time you visit Rae. Your mother and I will always be here. Now go!&quot; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae glanced back one last time at the city skyline. She had been a victim of her legacy, but now she was free. With a final breath, she turned away from the city and stepped forward, embracing the world that waited beyond.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go. The plane is here...We don&#39;t want to miss it...&quot; Elias motioned. Rae nodded, gave her father a final goodbye kiss, and then walked away. She followed closely with Elias, running towards the plane without looking back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I guess this is Ajespa&#39;s Acrimony...&quot; Randall laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;At least it&#39;s over and history is history,&quot; Maria added. The plane quickly took off and Rae was gone, with Elias to explore the world. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What do you want to do first?&quot; Elias smiled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know, you&#39;re the expert! You tell me!&quot; Rae laughed as she rested her head on Elias&#39;s shoulder. Elias looked out the window and took a sigh of relief, with the case finally being closed. He also knew that Barton and Anateros were far from being out of business.</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.kg66nnp86vcg"><span class="c3">IV - Roots of Airiman</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The static of his laptop quietly hummed in the background. Elias was once again, working tirelessly through the night on a report. He sat at his desk beside his dim lamp and was still tapping on the keys of his keyboard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The American Supernatural Intelligence Division was not lenient on any tasks. They had a strict and tight schedule, and Elias was not one of those members to stray from these rules. No, he was not anywhere near the top detectives in the division. He had only had a few encounters, and his last was nothing of a small feat, but rather a big one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He wanted to prove himself capable of taking on a higher position. Then, muffled footsteps echoed down the hallway outside, growing louder by the second. The door slowly creaked open. Through the small opening, a voice weakly whispered through. &quot;Why are you still up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Not now Rae...I&#39;m almost done...&quot; Elias replied as he stood up. Rae pushed the door open and entered Elias&#39;s room.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias, when are you going to go to bed...?&quot; Rae asked, rubbing her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias sighed, leaning back. &quot;I can&#39;t rest until I&#39;ve finished writing this report. It&#39;s important, it&#39;s about your case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My case...&quot; Rae began, playing with her lavender hair. She didn&#39;t know what to say, but it was important. Rae was unlike others, but her mystique was enchanting in a way that Elias couldn&#39;t deny. Although there was a much more complicated background, it was only Elias who was nice enough to accompany her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;ll only take about 5 more minutes...&quot; Elias reassured, with Rae watching eagerly at the screen as Elias typed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...Just get some rest...Don&#39;t worry about it too much...&quot; Rae smiled. She leaned down a little and gave Elias a big cuddle. Elias took his hands off the keyboard and gently squeezed her hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You have one new notification!&quot; a robotic voice alerted. Elias directed his sight back to the screen and opened his email inbox. At the very top, a new email appeared with the subject titled: &quot;Highly Classified&quot;. Elias opened the email and it read:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&#39;Dear Mr. Elias Novem,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Is this a good time? My name is Tristan Kniet, and I desperately need your help. Do you know of the Airiman&#39;s Essence?&#39;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Airiman&#39;s Essence...&quot; Elias hesitated, then added, &quot;It&#39;s an old legend from the Indigenous tribes here. They spoke of a spirit-I can&#39;t remember what it is exactly. I just know that my professor said it was a way for the land to speak to those who don&#39;t belong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae shivered. &quot;And this random guy wants your help?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yep,&quot; Elias smiled, pushing away from Rae&#39;s embrace.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes, yes. Now can you go to bed?&quot; Rae said, impatiently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, night,&quot; Elias motioned, leading Rae out and kissing her. The morning sun soon rose and the sunlight gently submerged the living room with a warm, soft light. Rae was still sound asleep whilst Elias was again, up first making breakfast.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Morning Rae,&quot; Elias comforted, gently tapping Rae on her shoulder. &quot;Wake up!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ugh...What time is it?&quot; Rae groaned as she rubbed her eyes. &quot;How come you sleep so late and still be able to wake up so early?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s only 9:00 am, not even that early!&quot; Elias laughed, sitting down beside Rae, on her bed. &quot;My Professor is only free at 10:00 am so we better hurry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias and Rae soon arrived at the small, cosy apartment block on 81 Welster Street, where Elias&#39;s professor had resided. Elias stepped up to the grandeur-looking entrance on the third floor and knocked on the professor&#39;s door. There was no answer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Maybe he&#39;s still asleep...&quot; Rae implied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias ignored her and knocked slightly harder. Slightly annoyed, Elias reached into his pockets, eventually finding two small keys.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Which one do you think fits?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm? Neither matches the keyhole..?&quot; Rae asked, confused.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re right, you need both keys...&quot; Elias demonstrated as he pieced together the keys in a specific way and gracefully unlocked the door, slowly pushing it open.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias carefully crossed the kitchen and approached his professor&#39;s study room, located on the far right side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Professor?&quot; Elias exclaimed, peeping his head inside. Instead of seeing the professor sitting upright at his desk, he was nowhere to be seen. It was a Saturday and normally, the professor would either be still asleep or at his desk working on lectures or marking papers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead of the presence of the professor, a curious-looking box sat sealed shut on his table. Elias carefully picked the box up and inspected it and found an engraving carved into the underside of the box.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Box of Dreams&quot; Elias read, putting it back down. His curiosity soon reached him and Elias couldn&#39;t hold back anymore. He wanted to open the box to see what was inside. He slid the lid off and the box was empty. Nothing was inside. Elias was confused. What had happened to his professor?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking for more answers, Elias found another box, assuming it was the packaging for the smaller wooden box that had mysteriously killed the professor. On it read an address, from the Northern Territory of Australia.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Fuck this, I&#39;m not getting paid enough...&quot; Elias sighed as he stormed outside and booked a plane ticket. Rae heard Elias march out and quickly followed behind, racing down the stairs outside the building.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Rae asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I need to go to Australia. I&#39;ll be back in a week.&quot; Elias explained. &quot;Look after yourself...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias held a worried look and quickly jumped into his car and drove off to the airport.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hey wait a minute! You can&#39;t just leave me here!&quot; Rae yelled, but it was no use. Elias had sped off as if he was more concerned about his professor and not Rae.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae was furious, but it didn&#39;t tangle her logic as her mind remained rational and calm. Rae quickly made her way back home then packed some necessities and headed towards the airport, buying a ticket herself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Australian air clung thick and hot. It was warmer than Elias and Rae had both thought, reaching up to temperatures of 32&#8304;C. The airport had a fresh minty aroma that made the surrounding barren desert feel modern and crispier. Elias squinted into the sun as he stepped out into the desolate terrain, feeling a sense of displacement as if the land was vibrating beneath his feat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias soon arrived at the location, a remote town nearing the centre of Australia. He checked in at a nearby hotel. The hotel was simple and old, to say the least, for it to look abandoned in the small town located in the empty desert was nothing new.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae on the other hand was behind, approximately by 8 hours or so. Rae found her way into Australia the next morning, in search of Elias. She didn&#39;t have any information on where he had gone, and she knew that this was also her mission to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon, Rae found a local hotel near Darwin. She knew she wanted to have some fun and explore what the isolated city of Darwin had to offer before she began her proper quest to find Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day 1: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias woke to the radio&#39;s dull chatter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; The voice droned on, static crackling slightly, an odd hiccup in the broadcast. He rolled his eyes, annoyed by the noise and turned it off without a second thought. Elias decided to explore the hotel and wandered into the mess of a dining hall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias...Elias...&quot; a voice rang as Elias ate his food.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias jerked around, looking around to find nobody. Then there was the tingling sensation that sent chills down Elias&#39;s spine as Elias for once in his life, felt afraid, and that someone was there to hunt him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias quickly finished his meal and left the hotel, heading out to the site.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t remember me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Um, ok? I mean, my name is Tristan Kniet after all. I guess you&#39;re only trying to help me...Unless you can solve this stupid mystery, you can&#39;t kindly leave me be,&quot; Tristan explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s the mystery?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, that...&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What about it?&quot; Elias questioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, every day they appear and surround the town.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then how did I get here at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know. They would stop at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes? And? What are you implying?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know how to get out...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Get out of what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;This town! I arrived last week, and ever since then, I&#39;ve been stuck here! I&#39;ve been paying absurd amounts of money to the hotel!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, can&#39;t you just make a call or something?&quot; Elias suggested, taking his phone out. As he tried to open his networking app, a red alert displayed the two words that shook Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;NO SIGNAL&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh. How did you send that email of yours though?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Like I said, I haven&#39;t sent an email!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;If you&#39;re gonna be like that, I&#39;m just going to leave,&quot; Elias replied, now frustrated again. He couldn&#39;t believe a client who emailed him didn&#39;t even know that he emailed him. As he walked through the town, he witnessed a man getting hit by a ball that some kids were playing with.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Elias tried to navigate through the dust storms, he could barely see and was forced to turn back. Still, Elias was determined to leave the town. He waited until the storms had calmed down. During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange that burnt the sandy terrain. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias ventured to the outskirts of the town. It was cold and dark outside, making this task quite difficult. Elias didn&#39;t give in though, for he explored quite far before he saw it. It wasn&#39;t a mere hallucination but strange beasts suddenly started to creep out from the bushes and startled Elias. He had never seen animals this large that loomed over him like towers. He felt vulnerable and was terrified. He had never seen anything like this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Those are megafauna, kid. That&#39;s the Diprotodon in front of you...&quot; a man laughed. Elias didn&#39;t find it funny.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You can see it?&quot; Elias screamed</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Obviously!&quot; the man laughed again. &quot;I&#39;d advise you to stay in this town. There are quite some scary monsters out there!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Elias screamed again. He suddenly realised why Kniet did not know how to escape. The town was cursed, somehow. Elias quickly made his way back into his room and passed the night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; the other broadcaster suddenly stuttered, as if the radio had glitched some sort. &quot;-we&#39;ll be continuing with dust storms in the afternoon,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias, frustrated, got up and turned the radio off. He was in a bad mood, and the radio only worsened it. It was like the radio was emitting deafening sound waves into his mind, vibrating so heavily that it gave him a headache.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The free breakfast was a nice change and Elias capitalised on this opportunity to have a feast. Hash Browns, eggs, bacon and various foods were all available and it was a treat to have some quality Australian food finally. Elias enjoyed every second of it. However, as Elias was eating the food, he felt like he had eaten this type of food before, even though he had never been to Australia, nor had he had any authentic Australian experiences back in the States like this. Something felt off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Elias finished his meal, he felt a sense of deja vu, but nothing clicked in his head. The subtle feeling kicked his mind awake, but yet he could not recall anything.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet?&quot; Elias asked as he approached the man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias Novem&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;That name rings a bell...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re the one who emailed me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I did?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Um, ok?

He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What about it?&quot; Elias questioned.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, every day they appear and surround the town.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then how did I get here at night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I don&#39;t know.

Elias laughed again with the man as if it felt natural. But it didn&#39;t feel normal. Each day felt so surreal as if it was repeating. Was he in Groundhog Day?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The quiet radio static turned into a deafening machine, alerting Elias out of his sleep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The broadcaster&#39;s voice sounded bizarrely similar, with the same sarcastic tone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand...&quot; the voice announced as if it were reading off a script. Elias froze. A cold unease settled in his chest. Elias didn&#39;t think again and threw the radio against the wall; he was frustrated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias wasn&#39;t hungry so he skipped breakfast. Instead, he headed immediately towards the site.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Kniet? Are you trying to get out this time of day, again?&quot; Elias yelled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who are you?&quot; the man asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;My name is Elias Novem. I was tasked by someone to help you...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Great! So, how do we get rid of that thing?&quot; Tristan motioned. He pointed towards the dust storms that surrounded the town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t,&quot; Elias explained. Elias&#39;s muscle memory had somehow kicked in and had overrode his actions. Elias was spitting everything out to his instinct&#39;s desire.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">During sunset, the skyline glowed a bright saturated orange, again. It was at that time, the storms had finally ended. Elias this time was aware and his body controlled his navigation systems, rerouting him to venture to a darker part of the town.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hmm...&quot; a man mumbled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Elias began. He crossed his arms and sternly looked at the man who was sitting on the wooden crates, holding a strange device.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Very well. But this isn&#39;t the solution you&#39;re looking for...&quot; the man hissed, with his words almost being inaudible. Elias flinched then he saw darkness. The man had knocked Elias out cold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day ???: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias was startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Today&#39;s weather calls for sand, isn&#39;t that right Jacob?&quot; the broadcaster announced.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Indeed Raymond, today-&quot; Elias jumped out of his bed and threw the radio across the room, annoyed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day felt repeated, with Elias remembering some things he did. But he knew something now. Before he left the hotel, Elias quickly snuck a pen and notepad into his jacket.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Throughout the day, Elias jotted everything down, allowing him to remember clearly. He knew something was odd about his thoughts and knew his logic was clouded by some strange unknown force. He wanted to test a theory as he knew there was something strange.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias again, found himself nearing the alleyway again that evening, passing by the same man he encountered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing a safe distance, Elias sketched out the strange device the man held and quickly tucked his notepad back into his jacket. The man was unfazed and did not notice Elias&#39;s presence. He sat there, using the device like a cigarette.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He quickly escaped the scene, going back to his hotel room and calling it a night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">-&laquo; Day 5: Elias &raquo;-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias was once again startled by the sound of the radio, suddenly turning on in the warm morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, Elias didn&#39;t even wait. Before the announcer could say a word, Elias had hurled the radio across the room, smashing it against the wall. &#39;Shut up!&#39; he yelled, gasping as the eerie sensation of deja vu washed over him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Elias put his jacket on, a piece of paper cut that was placed inside his jacket slipped out. What was this? Elias had never seen this paper before. He picked it up in confusion and saw impossible-looking sketches. Then, he found a notepad lodged in the other pocket of his jacket. When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;When he flipped through the notebook, he found a strange-looking diagram</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed to Elias to be some kind of map. Elias went to the marked spot at 17:30 and found it to be empty. However, just as Elias was about to leave, a man walked by.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Huh? How did you get here?!&quot; the man exclaimed. The man was in terror and fell backwards, dropping a strange device. Elias quickly peeked at the notepad and realised the device looked strangely similar to the object sketched. Elias dove for the device and snatched it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No!&quot; the man yelled. His voice grew in anger as he jumped towards Elias, trying to take the device back. Elias quickly dodged the man attempting to attack him and safely stood up with the device in his hands. &quot;You mustn&#39;t use it! You will die!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Me? Die?&quot; Elias questioned. He had felt like he had died multiple times now, reliving the same day. Elias toyed around with the device and suddenly started it. It began shooting out a strange yellow gas that quickly spread around. He didn&#39;t know how to stop it, but it began to grow larger and larger, spreading throughout the town. Elias inhaled the gas, taking a big breath in. It was a dangerous move, but he knew something about this device was letting this mysterious man remember and not be affected.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You idiot!&quot; the man yelled. He jumped up and attacked Elias. Again, Elias swiftly dodged his attack.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Stop lying. I think I know what&#39;s up now,&quot; Elias explained. The man froze in motion, eyes widening in terror. &quot;My memories...Or should I say the town&#39;s memories? They are getting reset each night...Time still moves normally, it&#39;s just our memories are wiped so our minds think we haven&#39;t moved forward&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And? Your current memories will just reset tomorrow morning! You can&#39;t do anything!&quot; the man laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Really, Tristan Kniet? You think that this is going to work?&quot; Elias mumbled. &quot;I know this town well enough now. You used the only computer in this town to send that email and pretended to lose your memories. That device you dropped, kills this drug. I remember clearly now. It all makes sense.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;No, this can&#39;t be!&quot; Tristan exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Firstly, the megafauna are all just mere illusions. They are centuries old and they cannot possibly come back to life. Secondly, you said to me to help get rid of those dust storms. How can one stop a dust storm? There are so many more flaws that give this hoax away. You are riddled with chaos...&quot; Elias explained.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I-&quot; Tristan croaked. &quot;Maybe...Just maybe I needed you to help free me from my madness. I discovered this drug and I almost died...and I wanted to show the world...but this cycle...the antidote...the money...it all sounded too good...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;m betting you, Anateros is behind this, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Elias laughed. Tristan suddenly fell to his knees, gasping for air.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How... how did you know?&quot; Tristan choked. The air grew thin for Tristan, and without the antidote, the drug quickly seeped through the ground into his body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His smile faded from a sinister grin and slowly formed an expression of despair, begging for the antidote. &quot;They tricked me! Please...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias frowned, his grip tightening on the antidote. &quot;You&#39;re pathetic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tristan let out a weak laugh, his voice hollow. &quot;They paid me so much...to lure you...to get rid of you...But it didn&#39;t work out...Our plans were rushed...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias threw the device and it shattered into pieces, the antidote scattering everywhere. The gas slowly sifted into the ground, destroying some of the drug.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;re an archaeologist. Enlighten me.&quot; Elias ordered. &quot;This drug needs to be exterminated, and investigated further,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias helped Tristan stand up, knowing that his motives were purely driven by Anateros&#39;s corrupt organisation, manipulating his actions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, I admit defeat. You&#39;ve bested me, Novem. This town once was the Airiman&#39;s villa, an Indigenous Tribe. They found these strange roots in South Australia and brought them up north to plant. What they didn&#39;t know was that it was actually a deadly drug that when planted in the wrong conditions, has severe aftereffects. We&#39;ve all experienced it. Hallucinations and memory loss.&quot; Tristan explained. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I have more of the antidote,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How do I get out of here?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Go, leave. Leave me alone in this town now,&quot; Tristan mumbled as he handed Elias a pair of keys and a capsule filled with the antidote. &quot;Use the antidote like a cigarette...One puff will last around 2 hours. Good luck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have one more question,&quot; Elias smiled, his midnight black eyes widening. The look of death stared Tristan down, sending a terrifying chill down his spine that shook his entire body. &quot;How much work did you go into buying new radios and repairing the wall every night?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tristan was in denial. How had he messed it up so badly? Then, Tristan remembered. His memories began to appear clearer than ever before, recalling back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;They were Anateros men. Two remained here, always, with protective gear. Go now before they come looking for me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This time, Elias was surprised, with his mouth hanging open. Anateros had not only been manipulating Tristan, but it was their discovery. Elias turned around and ran towards the old car.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Elias got a signal, he checked his phone. 10 missed calls from Rae. 64 missed calls from the American Supernatural Intelligence Division. He had messed up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back in Darwin, Rae had spent the past two weeks living off of Elias&#39;s credit card. Elias had completely lost track of time. He had spent countless days putting everything together and when he checked his balance, he was $10,000 in debt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae was quite literally having some of the best time in her life, being free and exploring new places. In just two weeks, she had bought various expensive clothes, tasted numerous mouth-watering foods and enjoyed many fun activities.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it was all about to end. Her phone rang at 23:00 sharp and her eyes lit up with joy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Elias?&quot; Rae said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Hi Rae...What the fuck have you done?&quot; Elias replied, angry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What...?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;$10,000 in debt?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, oops...&quot; Rae giggled, holding back her tears. &quot;I missed you, Elias, it&#39;s nice to hear your voice again. I bought you gifts!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;How are we meant to get back?&quot; Elias asked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Um...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You sometimes are so cheeky...&quot; Elias sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll call Sylvester to see what he can do...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias soon caught up with Rae at the hotel she was staying at. Elias apologised for running off without her and Rae was just glad to see Elias alive and back to normal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Alright, let&#39;s go home,&quot; Elias said as he rang the ASID&#39;s emergency contact number. He was tired and didn&#39;t want to file this as a case.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sylvester&#39;s voice squeaked over the subtle phone static as he picked up. &quot;Hello? Who&#39;s this?&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Sylvester, it&#39;s me. I&#39;ve been away...&quot; Elias replied.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t Novem...&quot; Sylvester laughed. &quot;Welcome back to life, kid. Our systems couldn&#39;t locate or reach you for 2 weeks and some speculated you were dead. Of course, I know you don&#39;t go down with a fight. What have you been up to?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, Sylvester, if you could be the protagonist in Groundhog Day while getting your memories wiped every day, would you want to be the protagonist?&quot; Elias asked. Sylvester was intrigued and leaned forward in his chair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You see Elias, this is a strange world. I would love to.&quot; Sylvester replied, laughing softly. &quot;All I can say is you might have just solved the case of the Lost Southern Drug. Congrats kid.&quot;</span></p><h3 class="c4" id="h.m49a2bwntrd"><span class="c3">V - Jespan&rsquo;s Star</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So Novem&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a great asset. You&rsquo;ve been outperforming these amateurs&hellip;&rdquo; His expression grew, his face still turned to Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mr Ozim,&rdquo; Elias began. &ldquo;These supernatural occurrences&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the mastermind behind the ASID, you don&rsquo;t need to worry. I&rsquo;ve linked these cases&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton explained as he shifted towards the whiteboard. The clinical meeting room enveloped a bitter tone, biting at Elias&rsquo;s skin. The whiteboard marker popped, scribbling following, scratching Elias&rsquo;s eardrums.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jaxton sketched a quick diagram, displaying Ajespa. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No royals or anything is linked to Georgia and Rae&hellip;My research tells me Rae isn&rsquo;t human. She&rsquo;s from another world&hellip;&rdquo; Jaxton sighed and placed his hand on Elias&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take care of her, right?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course&hellip;&rdquo; Elias stuttered, his voice suddenly shaking at this realisation. Elias had been so enchanted by her personality that he didn&rsquo;t notice the flaws of Rae. Her perfect English with no accent and her unique physique. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whiteboard stood menacingly back against the room, the contents on the board ever so terrifying. The words &ldquo;princess&rdquo; and a rough sketch of a UFO haunted Elias, confusing and worrying him. Just who was Rae? </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take this too seriously though kid, you&rsquo;ve made a name for yourself in the world, just take a look!&rdquo; Jaxton smiled, reaching for the remote that turned the small TV screen that hovered in the corner of the room. Though small, it was large enough to clearly show the headline of the news.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good afternoon Indiana, this is Skie Leanne of WXIN, today bringing an international news case! Government officials across the world have correctly identified an unknown flying machine entering the airspace of Georgia, landing in Vardzia. We don&rsquo;t know who or what they are and why they are here. Stay tuned for more.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You see Novem, this is a case that you should look forward to. Why don&rsquo;t you put that anthropology degree of yours to use? Eh, Novem? Huh?&rdquo; said Jaxton. Elias was gone already. &ldquo;Tch, that kid&hellip;Get my jet ready.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias rushed into the hallway and frantically dialled Rae&rsquo;s number. The numbers felt like frozen buttons, each tap sending a terrible chilling sensation. What was this occurrence?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Such a coincidence, Jaxton mentioning Rae was extra-terrestrial and now spaceships landing in Vardzia. It was real, but Elias kept trying to deny it. He believed that the spaceship was an illusion, rather another scheme plotted by Anateros.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae! Did you hear the news?&rdquo; Elias exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, I was about to call you!&rdquo; Rae&rsquo;s voice echoed. The speakers blasted slowly, reverberating. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stay there&hellip;&rdquo; Elias reassured, his voice calming down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias, are you taking this job or not?&rdquo; Jaxton&rsquo;s voice lingered down the hallway, Elias finally locking eyes with Jaxton. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me get Rae first,&rdquo; Elias reassured, giving Jaxton the green light to wait for him. Elias and Rae soon met Jaxton on the pitched runway where he parked his private jet. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shall we get in the air?&rdquo; Jaxton proposed, motioning for the two to enter. The interior was luxurious to say the least, with fancy cocktails and food. They flew as quickly as they could towards Vardzia, unbeknownst to them would lie the greatest case in history. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Elias and Rae ventured back into Vardzia, observing the large spaceship that landed in the mountains. Again, it seemed futuristic enough to resemble the now non-existent city of Ajespa, also matching the overall aesthetics they employed. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Out of nowhere, a battalion of troops emerged, alienlike. Of course they weren&#39;t human, but neither were they aliens. They were robots. They looked identical to those monsters they fought back in Old Ajespa, but scaled down by a lot. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The machines beeped. The static buzz tuned up into a deafening frequency, paralysing Elias. Rae stood unfazed, Elias struggling. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;JESPAN DETECTED. ANALYZING IDENTITY: HELLO PRINCESS MALVORR.&rdquo; The robots emitted. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! What are you&ndash; Aaah!&rdquo; Rae squealed. The robots definitely weren&#39;t kind, swiftly dragging Rae and Elias back into the ship. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Princess?&rdquo; crewmates chirped as Rae landed on the ship, walking towards the starboard. Though she had never been on a ship like this before, it felt like she had. A mystical sense of deja vu gushed down on her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Chain him up!&rdquo; the others chanted, the robots still carrying the paralysed Elias. On the east side, the robots held Elias against the wall and stripped his shirt, then chaining him into place. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The metal straps tightly held Elias in place, as if he was crucified. The metallic surface was cold, his weak body leaning forward in despair. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You! Stay away from the princess of Ajespa!&rdquo; a voice rang.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! Let him go!&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice echoed. It felt like two sides were fighting for him, one to torture him further and the other to save him. But it was Rae against the whole crew. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae, do you forget who we are?&rdquo; a new voice crackled. Elias&#39;s eyes finally opened slowly, scanning the perimeter. He saw humanoid like people, of course he knew they weren&#39;t humans as they hovered like superheroes from a fictional world. Their appearance indeed mimicked humans almost perfectly and from what Elias could hear, their personalities were robust. &ldquo;We came to Earth not to find love, we came for the Orichalcum&hellip;We came back now again&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae&#39;s voice suddenly grew weak and her expression went pale. His majesty&#39;s ominous aura flooded the starboard, his voice deep and hypnotic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;KILL HIM.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crew beat Elias, blood spewing everywhere. It was brutal and Rae couldn&#39;t bear to watch. The beating turned into a show, with several crewmates throwing objects at him and making a mockery out of him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;WAIT.&rdquo; His majesty ordered. &ldquo;STOP.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crew listened and pulled back, with Elias barely breathing. It was obvious the crew was not good at killing, with their puny attempts to damage him failing, with all his vital organs and bones still intact. All that they had done was give Elias the rotten impression that this race was corrupt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As the Jespan&rsquo;s race&#39;s ruler, I inquire what has brought you here?&rdquo; His majesty&#39;s deep magenta beard brushed against Elias&#39;s hair as he towered above him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elias, trying to piece together his words, was barely able to speak. &ldquo;I&hellip;I&hellip;Rae&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae suddenly snapped into a state, even herself being unaware of it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The static hum pierced Rae&#39;s mind, suddenly recalling the nothingness of a room in the spaceship. Was she hallucinating? No, it was more than just a hallucination. It was a message, a vision. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The voice, it was of her real mother. Her voice whispered silently in her mind. The memories churned, her anger dissipated.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This star is the last of our race! The protectors who have adorned them, and yet, you don&#39;t wish for us to survive?&rdquo; her mother echoed. The ethereal flashback she experienced felt unreal, she knew she had never been in that position where she witnessed her parents arguing. Perhaps it was before her birth? It couldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;These protectors are useless, they fall out of the sky, one by one! They are worth nothing if the Avidrones can kill them so easily!&rdquo; her father yelled. His voice hadn&#39;t changed, that stubborn, egotistical old man of a father she had.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please Kareth&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No Halena, it must be done,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This world is no place for our child! That Orichalcum rich planet&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You mean that planet Earth? Tch, to hell!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her mind raced. She knew her real father, Kareth, was no one to believe in heroes. She assumed he had no knowledge of the Orichalcum star.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She took out the pendant that she had treasured. Though hazy, she could still vividly remember this pendant came with her arrival on Earth. Perhaps it was a sign? Maybe it was the Orichalcum star?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae! Focus on this!&rdquo; His majesty threatened. &ldquo;Is that an Orichalcum star?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Um&hellip;yes? Can I give it to him&hellip;?&rdquo; Rae asked, not knowing what it did.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What? Give him&hellip;the Orichalcum star?&rdquo; His majesty laughed. Rae, frustrated, shoved the small star shaped crystal deep into Elias&#39;s body, penetrating his skin and ripping apart his flesh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aaargh!&rdquo; Elias screamed in pain. The star bled into his blood, a deep violet glow radiated from his skin. His vision grew hazy, and particles began to appear.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&#39;m so sorry! Please, save yourself&hellip;&rdquo; Rae wept as the crew forcefully pulled her away from Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You stupid girl! Our Orichalcum star is gone now!&rdquo; His majesty roared. &ldquo;TAKE HER AWAY. AND ACTUALLY KILL THE GUY FOR REAL THIS TIME.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crew dragged Rae away and the rest focused on killing Elias. There was no hope. Punch after punch, the crew gasped for breath, growing ever so tired, hurting Elias.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Man, I never thought killing somebody with your fist was hard&hellip;&rdquo; a crewmate mumbled. The particles appeared again. They emerged from the bodies. The flake-like shape particles slowly drifted towards Elias. He slowly breathed them in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do ya think Malvorr would say this is good enough?&rdquo; another crewmate huffed. All out of breath, Elias&#39;s breathing picked up in pace, his veins glowing brighter each second in a menacing purple. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey hey hey now! You can&#39;t call his majesty Malvorr! If you get caught we&#39;ll be executed!&rdquo; another remarked. &ldquo;Remember his Orichalcum star infused blade? The Starslayer&hellip;It destroyed our planet&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey&hellip;what&#39;s happening to him?&rdquo; Another added, his attention turning back to Elias. The crew gathered around, puzzled by Elias&#39;s state. A large outburst suddenly propelled the chains that confined Elias back, followed by a humongous purple supernova-like explosion.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The majority of the crew were knocked out instantly, crashing into the hard metallic walls. Shattered glass and steel shards vibrated on the ground, piercing the air that was once warm. The room was clinically cold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae, who was interrogated by her real father, suddenly heard the loud, painful sounds of crewmates falling. The conversation was interrupted and King Malvorr was angry. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae. You have been blinded. I, Kareth Malvorr, your real father will show you the true world,&rdquo; King Malvorr mumbled, reaching for the Starslayer. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The blade was slick, a golden handle with grey engravings of his name &ldquo;Malvorr&rdquo; glistened underneath the warm lights the haven provided. As he stepped out into the hallways, his blade scraped the ground, a painful sound complimented by the slow, purple pulsing the core of the sword emitted. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Rae Malvorr, my dearest daughter&hellip;How have you come to like these humans?&rdquo; King Malvorr grumbled, his expression growing even angrier, his voice carrying a heavy sense of frustration. No, he didn&#39;t only feel betrayed by her daughter, he was disappointed. &ldquo;Helena, you don&#39;t know what you have started&hellip;That mission&hellip;you lied to me&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">King Malvorr&#39;s grim frown was permanent, his past was too traumatic. Him and Helena were never on good terms. But the mission? That was different. He had thought Helena had left Rae on Earth to command, build an army to mine Orichalcum for their race but this? To fall in love with a human? It was sickening. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kareth Malvorr I presume&hellip;?&rdquo; Elias smiled, all energetic. His energy was restored, taking on a fancy suit of armor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you&hellip;?&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed, frustrated. &ldquo;Senturies! Go!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A swarm of small, dwarf-like machines flew out from a hatch, attacking Elias. His vision grew clear, more energy particles releasing from every movement of the drones. No, it wasn&#39;t that the machines were getting tired, rather it was the excess or waste energy they produced. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; Elias gasped, coming to his senses. He could see his true power, his true potential, to manipulate wasted energy into something strong. &ldquo;Implode!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">His voice channelled through the ship, followed by a chain of small explosions that blew up the swarms of small drone-like creatures. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?!&rdquo; King Malvorr exclaimed. &ldquo;That&#39;s it&hellip;Feel the wrath of my Starslayer!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The heavy blade clashed against Elias&#39;s energy armor, able to resist and absorb all damage. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This&hellip;feels&hellip;amazing!&rdquo; Elias chuckled. A clump of particles drifted towards Elias where he formed a sword of himself. &ldquo;I have no clue how this works&hellip;&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A bright, periwinkle sword manifested from energy appeared in Elias&#39;s hands, radiating ethereal like waves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This&hellip;can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr exclaimed. Elias rushed in, striking Malvorr. Malvorr fought back heroically, but unable to keep up with the flurry of attacks Elias was producing. &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Striking the ground with his Starslayer, the sword drew out a massive outburst of energy, sucking the energy from Elias leaving him weak and fragile. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now&hellip;DIE.&rdquo; Malvorr growled, his sword pulsing faster and faster. Elias couldn&#39;t move, he was deprived of energy and moreover, his face was covered in blood. The crimson red liquid dripped slowly to the ground, each drop vibrating as the heavy steps of Malvorr drew closer. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Malvorr struggled to lift the sword as it was heavy from all the energy it stored, needing him to exert extra energy into it. As he huffed and puffed ready to execute Elias, his breath slowly slipped into Elias, giving him just enough energy to create a small shard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Orichalcum Star was rotating fast in the sword&#39;s hilt, and as the sword came down, Elias smirked, rolling away and stabbing the overflowing star into oblivion. It exploded, leaving an overwhelming force that instantly broke the star and knocked both Elias and Malvorr away. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Please wake up&hellip;&rdquo; Rae cried. Elias was weak, the explosion injuring him heavily. His eyes ever so slightly opened, giving Rae a sense of hope. She sighed a happy sigh of relief. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No&hellip;no&hellip;no&hellip; This can&#39;t be!&rdquo; Malvorr shouted, as if he wasn&#39;t impacted by the explosion. &ldquo;You ruined my sword! Leave me, and for you Rae, I&#39;m disgusted. I&#39;m leaving you here&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprisingly, the ship was still intact, no major damage except for the breached doors and crushed machinery. Malvorr rushed to the deck and shifted gears. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You can&#39;t leave us!&rdquo; Rae exclaimed, demanding for a proper answer. Malvorr, defeated, threw a furious look then chucked a sphere-like object at them. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Knock yourselves out.&rdquo; said Malvorr, gritting his teeth. He slammed the button that opened the hatch, dropping both Rae and Elias back outside, in Vardzia. The ship took off quickly, soaring into space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elias&hellip;Are you alright?&rdquo; Rae asked. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ugh&hellip;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; Elias chuckled. Rae toyed around with the sphere, appearing to be a projector of some sort. Then, a hologram appeared.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dear Rae, if you&#39;re watching this, this means our race is almost extinct. The Avidrones have conquered our planet and I was the one who left you on Earth. I wanted you to be safe, away from warfare. This also means that you have the last Orichalcum Star. They are powerful items that can unleash astronomical powers. These superpowers once created strong and reliant protectors, but now it&#39;s your choice to help save our race. Choose your hero that will protect us.&rdquo; The hologram was of Helena Malvorr, her real mother. It felt surreal seeing her mother for the first time. &ldquo;Also, you might find yourself adapting to life on Earth quite easily. Us Jespans have a few quirks, having incredible memory, being multilingual and being able to short fly. Good luck, dear.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jaxton&#39;s voice echoed from afar, calling out their names. Elias and Rae sat in peace. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Dear lord, what happened to you two? I saw a bunch of robots kidnapping you guys, and now you&#39;re almost dead!&rdquo; Jaxton sighed. &ldquo;Thank god we didn&#39;t lose Elias,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rae sniffed, holding back her tears for what she had experienced. Were the Jespans really that bad? And what&#39;s next? Did Anateros know about their existence already? It was all a big mystery. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you all okay?&rdquo; Jaxton reassured, helping Elias up back into the Jet. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He will be fine&hellip;He&#39;s a hero&hellip;&rdquo; Rae whispered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course, he&#39;s my best,&rdquo; Jaxton boasted. Rae shook her head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, I mean like a superhero,&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Kid got superpowers?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes. It&#39;s a long story. I&#39;ll tell you the story later. It&#39;s what my race, the Jespans, call the Jespan Star.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
