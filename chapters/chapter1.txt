The scorching sun glazed the earthy tones of the Northern Territory, greeting the minibus that trailed into the gravel and sand roads that led to Ayers Rock, otherwise known as Uluru. It was extremely hot, and Ashley did not enjoy it at all. Living in Australia was hard enough, but traveling to such an isolated place in such hot conditions was killing her, physically and mentally.

Though she was at a young age of 16, she hated school and disliked what she had to go through. The education system was extremely poorly designed, consisting of content that one didn’t need at all in the future. As the minibus pulled up on the side of the road next to the humongous rock, the students of Valley High School flocked out from the bus one by one. 

"Ashley Thyst!" the teacher called out.

"Here…” Ash mumbled, tying up her scarf to protect her from the sun. As she stepped out of the old minibus, the sun blinded her, the beams shining directly into her blue eyes.  

"How do you even manage to wear that scarf of yours, Thyst?" the teacher asked.

"I hate the sun…It’s also my dad’s." Ash replied stubbornly, walking towards the rock at her own accord. 

Ash wandered around the base of the massive sandstone monolith, her fingers trailing lightly over the ancient carvings etched into its weathered surface. The grooves and patterns felt alive beneath her touch, as if whimsical stories were etched into the rock itself. It was clear this landmark was a sacred piece of Aboriginal history, preserved and protected for generations. But Ash had never been one to follow the rules. 

She was a rebel, through and through. Rules were more like suggestions to her, and the constant drone of her teacher’s voice about the geological wonders of Ayers Rock only fueled her desire to break free. While the group stood clustered together, listening intently, Ash was on the other side of the rock. Her eyes scanned the rock face for a way up and with a mischievous grin, she found her footholds and began to climb, her movements quick and deliberate. 

The top of the monolith was unlike anything she’d expected. The surface was uneven, scattered with rocks that seemed deliberately placed. Ash crouched down, her curiosity piqued. She pressed her hand against one of the rocks, and to her surprise, it shifted. With a soft grinding sound, a small opening appeared in the rock. Her heart raced as she glanced over her shoulder to make sure no one had noticed. The coast was clear. Without a second thought, she slid through the narrow gap and into the cool, dark embrace of the monolith.

Inside, the air was still and cool, carrying the faint scent of earth and time. The darkness was absolute, but Ash wasn’t afraid. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her trusty flashlight, flicking it on. The beam of light cut through the blackness, illuminating the walls of the cave. Her breath caught in her throat.

“Whoa…” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

The walls were covered in intricate carvings—ancient markings that told stories she couldn’t yet understand. Strange drawings of people with slingshots and other tools seemed to dance in the flickering light. But what really caught her eye was an icon on the far left side of the cave. It depicted five creatures, one at the center surrounded by four others, each with distinct markings and styles. They seemed almost… alive, as if they were watching her.

Ash leaned closer, her flashlight trembling slightly in her hand. The carvings were mesmerizing, pulling her into their mystery. But just as she reached out to touch the central figure, a faint sound broke the silence. It was soft, almost melodic, like the chirp of a small bird. She froze, her pulse quickening. 

From the shadows, something moved. Ash jerked back, her flashlight beam darting toward the source. There, emerging from the darkness, was a small, glowing creature. It was unlike anything she’d ever seen—a slug, but not quite. Its body shimmered with an otherworldly light, casting faint patterns on the cave walls as it inched closer. 

Ash’s breath hitched. She didn’t know whether to run or stay, but one thing was certain: she had stumbled into something far bigger than she could have imagined. 

"What are you?" Ash asked, her voice filled with awe.

The slug seemed excited, signaling for Ash to follow. Intrigued, she did. The walls were murky, overgrown with moss that seeped into the cracks. A faint dripping sound echoed throughout the dense tunnel, spooking Ash out even more. The deeper into the tunnel they went, it felt more claustrophobic until they reached a small opening, with a slate standing in solitude with mysterious writing engraved in it.

"Protected by the Thyst Family" Ash read aloud, her eyes widening. "Is this fate?"

The slug hopped onto the slate, pointing to a set of symbols: Chaos, Time, Space, and Persistence. It then jumped under the Time symbol, revealing its name—Tempora.

"Tempora?" Ash mused. "What is this place? Is it this Slugterra place dad always mentioned?"

The slug nodded. Ash rolled her eyes, but she knew it was better than going back. She chuckled, assuming that she was to carry on some legacy of some sort. “Alright, I’ll name you Vinnie for short, I really don’t like the name Tempora…”

The slug jumped up happily. Ash picked it up, giggling. "Aren't you a cute one?"

The slug motioned Ash to follow and Ash followed eagerly, navigating the dark tunnels. If it wasn’t for the slug’s faint glow, she could never see in these tunnels.

Vinnie soon led Ash to a seat of some kind that was hidden behind a pile of rubble, practically invisible to a human.

"So this is the drop my dad told me about... A way to Slugterra!" Ash exclaimed, sitting down. Vinnie nodded. "Does this thing still work?"

She pushed the button beside the seat and nothing happened. The ground opened up beneath her, and she fell.

Ash's scream echoed as she plummeted, but her fall slowed dramatically. Vinnie had reached velocimorph form, activating its time-slowing ability.

"Huh? What's happening?" Ash exclaimed, her panic turning to confusion as she floated gently down. Ash forcefully pushed the restraints back, and carefully stood up. As they neared the ground, Ash jumped out of the seat.

She landed safely on the ground, the surreal landscape of Slugterra stretching out before her.

"Vinnie, so this is Slugterra?" she asked.

Vinnie nodded, hopping onto her shoulder. 

"So where are we off to?" Ash was indeed puzzled by the labyrinth of caverns Slugterra had to offer as she had no idea where to start. Heck, she didn't even know which direction to start exploring in.
