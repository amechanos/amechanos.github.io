The fantastical landscape was so surreal that Ash couldn’t piece together her thoughts. She imagined Slugterra would mirror the land above, all sand and desert, with extremely humid and hot weather conditions. 

It wasn’t long for her to realise that the spot she had landed was actually a small oasis surrounded by a barren scrapland full of sand and strong winds. Metallic scraps dug into the sand and rocks pierced the earth, creating an unsettling tone.

“Which way?” Ash asked Vinnie, who hopped on ahead. Vinnie directed Ash through the desert and soon found a small gravel path that seemed to lead somewhere. And it did lead to a place, a city to be specific. It was Steamvale.

The bustling town of Steamvale welcomed Ash with its steampunk charm. As she wandered through the streets, Ash marvelled at the intricate machinery and the mechanical marvels that adorned the town. The sign reading "Welcome to Steamvale" greeted her, giving her a sense of both excitement and trepidation. Vinnie, her newly named Tempora slug, perched on her shoulder, eyeing the surroundings with equal curiosity.

Ash's thirst led her to the Blackboar Tavern, a place that seemed lively despite the early hour. As she entered, the smoky aroma of grilled food filled the air. The bar was crowded with patrons, their eyes following her every move. Ash tried to ignore the stares and approached the counter. A large, burly man with a gruff demeanor stepped forward.

"Can I get a drink?" Ash asked politely.

The bartender laughed, his voice booming. "A drink? You got an ID?"

"Uhm…No?" she replied, feeling slightly uneasy.

The bartender's expression changed from amusement to disdain. "Well, get outta here! We don’t serve minors!"

Laughter erupted from the patrons, and Ash's face burned with humiliation. "Not even water?" she demanded, her voice shaking with anger. The patrons laughed even harder.

"No water! You wanna fight for some?" the bartender challenged, pointing a blaster loaded with a Ramstone slug at her.

Ash backed away, hands raised. "Okay, sorry! I'll leave!"

She stormed out of the tavern, her cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and fury. "What’s up with them?" she muttered to Vinnie. "Are all these people like this??"

Vinnie shrugged, not having an answer.

Determined to find some respite, Ash entered the Cloudwork Tavern that stood in the corner of the town. The bells jingled as she stepped inside, the place smaller and more rugged than the previous one. Cobwebs adorned the corners, and a slug dashed out the door as she entered.

"New customer?" the bartender said, looking up from his work.

"Not popular like the others?" Ash asked, sceptical.

"What do you think? You got eyes?"

"Yes?"

"You want a drink? You seem dehydrated,"

"Yes please," Ash sighed, sweat dripping from her forehead. She slicked back her messy sienna hair, getting a better view of the tavern’s interior.

The bartender poured her a glass of water, and Ash drank it down gratefully. "You're Leon Thyst’s daughter, aren’t you?" he asked, observing her closely.

"How'd you know?"

"Well, the scarf, isn’t it obvious? And your slug,"

Ash's eyes widened in surprise, flustered. Her cheeks blushed cherry red. 

"Leon Thyst, your father, was a frequent customer here. Anyone would recognize that Tempora slug. It's his signature slug."

Ash's heart skipped a beat. "How do you know my father? Why did he come here?"

"The name's Lance," the bartender introduced himself. He flicked back his silky golden hair and continued, "My father was a sniper back in his day, but when he hurt his back, he retired. He was your father's best friend, so he got me to help him when he retired. I've since mastered the sniper."

"So, how old are you now?" Ash inquired, intrigued.

"Sixteen. A master of the sniper. My father's sniper genes allowed me to master this stuff in just three years... and I've helped your father once before he disappeared."

Ash's eyes sparkled with hope. "Oh... Say, do you wanna join me and find out where my father went?"

"Ummm…sure?"

Ash smiled. 

"By the way, do you at least have a blaster?" Lance asked.

Ash shook her head. "Oh, I don't have any..."

Lance sighed and stood up. "Alright, follow me. I wanna show you something..."

Lance led Ash out the back door of the Cloudwork Tavern. The light of the crystals overhead reflected off the metallic surfaces of the steampunk town, casting a bright glare. Lance stopped beside a sleek, gleaming mech. Customised with a dingo shaped head, the mech looked modern and sleek.

"This is my ride," Lance said proudly, patting the dingo's head. "A Voltswagon GTI, the latest model around. Your father left his mech too. It's old but super customised. The engineer behind it was none other than the great Maven."

Ash's eyes widened as she walked over and took the ragged sheets off the mech. Her eyes widened at the sight. 

"Wow! It looks so cool! And it's super clean!" Ash exclaimed.

Lance nodded, a grin spreading across his face. "Your dad did have some style!"

Ash got on, turned the engine on and the mech roared. 

"Well, we're getting you a blaster first so follow me. Driving these mechs is easy, c'mon!" Lance smiled.

Ash pulled the gear down and the beast accelerated, speeding off. 

“Ah!” Ash exclaimed, trying to maintain her balance. Lance laughed and rode parallel to Ash, helping her get a grip on her mecha beast. 

The journey through the desert was challenging, at least for Ash. It was her first time driving, let alone driving a four-legged beast. 

The desert stretched endlessly under the blazing sun, its dunes shimmering like molten gold. The air rippled with heat, distorting the horizon into a mirage of liquid light. The rhythmic thud of mechanical legs echoed across the barren expanse as their mechs marched forward, their massive frames kicking up clouds of fine sand that hung in the air like glittering dust. Each step sent a cascade of golden particles swirling around them, diffusing the Solaryte light into a hazy glow.

"Why is it so hot anyway?" Ash asked, wiping sweat from her brow.

Lance shrugged. "Don't know much. Just a bunch of myths that date back hundreds of years. And the water? The Kinderling dried it up. It's capable of evaporating liquids very quickly. Quite deadly."

He brought the mech to a halt and gestured toward a large, industrial-looking door. 

"We're here." Lance grumbled. The exterior of the forge was more torn down the last time he had come. Scraps at the door and more dents in the door. The rusted walls stood high and Lance approached it.

Lance knocked on the door. "Hey pops! New girl wants her first blaster. Can you do something?"

The door creaked open, and a figure approached them. 

"Who's this?" The man growled.

"Grayroad, this is Ashley, she's new around here so I'd thought we'd be able to pop in..."

Grayroads's thin physique along with his grey lightning bolt-shaped moustache stood out to Ash whose eyes lit up. He walked with a noticeable limp, his prosthetic leg clunking against the floor.

Grayroad sighed and sat down in a chair, taking a sip of his coffee. "Lance, you know it's been tough lately. The Emperor and his War Boys have been raiding my supplies. I don't know if I can make a blaster for her."

Lance's expression hardened. 

"Grayroad, you have to! She's a close friend of Maven..." Lance lied.

Grayroad's eyes widened in recognition. "Maven? Say no more. However, I still need materials. A Nimbus accelerator, a solaryte fragment, and a cryosphere magnet. I have the perfect blaster in mind."

Lance nodded. "Alright then. But she's unarmed for now. Do you have anything she can use while we hunt?"

Grayroad stood up and rummaged through a chest, pulling out an old, yet well-maintained blaster. "Take this... your father's old blaster. It'll keep up."

Ash accepted the blaster with a mix of gratitude and reverence. "Thanks."

Suddenly, the door was kicked open. A large figure stormed in, dual blasters drawn and ready to fire. 

"You've got some nerve still coming to this old geezer's place! Give me all your slugs! And where's the Solaryte Battery we asked for?" the intruder demanded.

"It's almost done!" Grayroad's hands trembled slightly as he scrambled through his drawers looking for the blueprint.

"Hey... you're messing with the wrong people!" Lance stepped forward, his eyes narrowing. Reaching for his blaster, his speedstinger slug jumped in ready for action.

Ash, her heart pounding, backed him up. "Yeah! What he said!"

"And what?" the intruder yelled as he hauled two Tempestos at Lance and Ash.

In a swift motion, Ash pulled out her blaster and fired her Tempora slug. Vinnie's time-slowing ability activated, giving Lance the chance to fire his Speedstinger slug. The brute was hit directly in the face, falling to the ground with a heavy thud.

"Impressive, but Tempora ain't gonna be useful in all situations." Lance nodded. "I could've taken him out without the use of your slug."

"Her name is Vinnie!" Ash scoffed.

"Oh, naming slugs, are we? Meet Bingo." Lance smiled, introducing his own slug, a Speedstinger.

Grayroad approached, his expression serious. "Kid, Lance is right. That one Tempora slug ain't enough. Being a Thyst means you fight, fight the emperor and stop the mess. This place is already a wasteland. Take my Forgesmelter. It's rare and packs a big punch."

"Thank you." Ash said happily, accepting the slug in her palms.

Lance guided Ash back to their mechs. "Follow me. We need to gather those parts."

As they sped off toward Vein Rocks, Ash felt a mix of fear and excitement. She was on the path her father once walked, ready to uncover the secrets of his past and forge her own destiny in Slugterra.
