    p1: "Spaceslinger is a puzzle adventure video game developed for my VCE Media Studies Unit 3/4 project in 2025. The game centres on Elias Novem, a 19-year-old superhero whose powers are stolen by Magha, a necromancer who summons elemental skeletons to devastate the landscapes of East Timor. Rather than losing his abilities entirely, Elias discovers his powers have transformed into four cosmic creatures representing the classical elements: Fire, water, earth, and air where he must learn to wield in order to reclaim peace. The game's core purpose is to use an underutilised mechanic in the mobile and casual gaming space: the drawing mechanic. Unlike mainstream titles that treat drawing as a superficial gimmick, Space Slinger is built entirely around it, requiring players to physically draw paths to guide their creatures into battle. This design philosophy pushes players to think creatively and strategically, demonstrating that drawing mechanics can serve as a deep, meaningful form of interaction rather than a novelty.",
    p2: "The project began with extensive research and case studies across film, television, and games with it being primarily drawing inspiration from Slugterra to inform both the narrative direction and gameplay design. Production experiments were conducted in art style, score composition, portal design, and colour grading before a final form was chosen. After surveying peers, a video game was selected over a short film or comic. Pre-production involved detailed planning including a game flowchart, wireframes, level designs, enemy mechanics, sprite frames, and full comic panel narratives for the prologue and epilogue. The game was built in Godot 4.4, with all assets — characters, backgrounds, UI, and animations created in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Key coding challenges included collision logic, menu visibility through global scripts, and interface input handling. Following peer playtesting and iterative feedback, the game was refined with additions like boss jump indicators, a Help button, and rebalanced levels. The final product was exported as both a Windows executable and Android APK, and published on itch.io alongside a game trailer and promotional materials.",

      "Implement a robust State Machine for player and enemy logic to eliminate 'collision pass-through' bugs encountered during high-speed movement.",
      "Refactor the tutorial UX using contextual highlighting instead of text-heavy dialogue to better guide the player's eye during the 'length' mechanic intro.",
      "Using a singular stage scene with dynamic loading of assets and enemies, rather than separate scenes for each level, to reduce load times and memory usage on mobile devices.",
      "Optimize the signal system in Godot to decouple UI elements from game logic, making the codebase more modular and easier to scale."

    p1: "Treed was my VCE Visual Communications & Design 3/4 Project built in Figma. This project is a mobile interactive experience designed to reconnect younger audiences with nature by transforming everyday walks into a mindful and rewarding journey. Developed in response to increasing disconnection from the natural world and rising mental health challenges among Millennials and Gen Z, the app encourages users to grow virtual trees by physically walking outdoors. Each tree begins as a sapling and develops through consistent activity, daily tasks, and mindful engagement, creating a symbolic link between personal wellbeing and natural growth. Inspired by the Japanese practice of Shinrin-yoku (forest bathing), the experience promotes calmness, reflection, and awareness through minimal interface design and gentle motivational systems. By combining collection mechanics similar to games like Pokémon Go with nurturing concepts seen in Tamagotchi and wellbeing elements from Voidpet Garden, the app bridges digital engagement with real-world movement. The purpose is not only to gamify walking, but to cultivate intrinsic motivation, helping users build lasting habits that improve both mental and physical health while fostering a deeper connection to Australian natural environments.",
    p2: "The project began with extensive research into the symbolism of trees, mindfulness practices, and existing nature-based interactive experiences. I analysed wellbeing apps, gamified walking platforms, and motivation systems to understand how digital design can encourage real-world behavioural change. From this research, I defined a clear design brief targeting younger users who may feel disconnected from nature. I then moved into ideation and prototyping, developing wireframes that mapped out the user journey — including the home screen, walking tracker, task panel, leaderboard, and growth display. These were refined through peer feedback, particularly improving navigation and scroll indicators to enhance intuitiveness for broader audiences. High-fidelity mock-ups were created in Figma, applying a muted green palette, minimalist iconography, and a geometric-organic hybrid style to reflect calmness and clarity. Alongside the interactive experience, I developed a cohesive brand identity to expand the project’s reach to older audiences. This included designing a logo using negative space, selecting a handwritten typeface for warmth, and creating a retro-inspired mascot named Potts to inject playfulness and encouragement. The branding was applied across app screens, promotional posters, and environmental signage to ensure consistency.",

      "Refine visual cohesion between the 'Potts' mascot and the minimalist UI by aligning the 'groovy vintage' line-work with the app’s clean vector style.",
      "Enhance user navigation by adding more intuitive visual indicators for the scroll-state, reducing friction for first-time users.",
      "Integrate AR-driven sensory tasks (e.g., audio identification of birds) to move from extrinsic rewards to deeper 'forest bathing' mindfulness."
